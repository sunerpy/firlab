# The browser viewer <StatusTag status="preview" />

This page shows how to open CodeGraph's browser viewer and what each of its views is for.

The viewer reads a project's existing index and shows it in a browser on your own computer: a symbol with its callers,
source and callees side by side, a file's outline, the call path from one function to another, the repository as a
map of modules, a type's hierarchy and the code nothing reaches. It is a **preview**: it is switched off unless you
turn it on, and the views may still change.

## Open it

```sh
CODEGRAPH_UI=1 codegraph ui                # the indexed project you are in
CODEGRAPH_UI=1 codegraph ui ~/code/my-app  # another indexed project
CODEGRAPH_UI=1 codegraph ui --no-open      # print the address; do not open a browser
CODEGRAPH_UI=1 codegraph ui --read-only    # also refuse to save trails
```

Without `CODEGRAPH_UI=1` the command is refused and left out of `--help`. The viewer listens on `127.0.0.1`, on port
4747 or the next free one after it (`--port` picks one), and stops with `Ctrl+C`.

It never builds or changes the index: index the project first with `codegraph init`. The only thing it writes is a
**trail** you choose to save, a walk through the code kept under `.codegraph/ui/trails/`.

Press `Ctrl+K` (`⌘K` on macOS) anywhere to search for a symbol or a file, or to ask for a path such as
`how does checkout reach tax`.

## Symbol

<ScreenFigure src="/screens/viewer-symbol-light.webp" dark="/screens/viewer-symbol-dark.webp" width="1440" height="900" alt="The Symbol view of the method IndexPaths::resolve: callers on the left, the source with each call marked in the middle, and the functions it calls on the right." />

The middle column is the symbol's source, with every call it makes marked in the margin and linked to the column on
the right, which lists what it calls. The left column lists its callers, grouped by file. Under them, **blast radius**
counts what a change would reach: direct callers, callers within three hops, and the production and test files among
them. Every name opens that symbol, and the trail bar at the top keeps the path you took.

## Type hierarchy

<ScreenFigure src="/screens/viewer-hierarchy-light.webp" dark="/screens/viewer-hierarchy-dark.webp" width="1440" height="900" alt="The Symbol view of the trait FrameworkResolver, with a type hierarchy listing the eight types that implement it." />

For a class, interface or trait, the Symbol view adds its hierarchy: what it extends and implements above, and what
extends or implements it below. A call through such a type is flagged when it dispatches to several implementations,
because no single static target exists.

## File

<ScreenFigure src="/screens/viewer-file-light.webp" dark="/screens/viewer-file-dark.webp" width="1440" height="900" alt="The File view of index_paths.rs: the files that import it on the left, its outline with incoming and outgoing counts in the middle, and its own imports on the right." />

A file's outline lists its symbols in source order with how much points in and out of each. The side columns are the
files that import it and the files it imports; names outside the index, such as standard-library paths, are listed
but not linked. **Whole-file source** shows the file line by line with its calls.

## Flow

<ScreenFigure src="/screens/viewer-flow-light.webp" dark="/screens/viewer-flow-dark.webp" width="1440" height="900" alt="The Flow view from cmd_explore to explore_file_header: five cards, one per hop, each opened at the line that makes the next call, and a table of every hop with its confidence." />

Flow answers "how does A reach B": each card is one hop, opened at the line that makes the next call, and the table
below lists every hop with where the call is and how confidently it was resolved. This capture is CodeGraph's own
`codegraph explore` command reaching the engine that also serves the MCP tool. When no chain of calls connects the
two, the view says so and names the usual reasons, such as a callback or a reflective call.

## Map

<ScreenFigure src="/screens/viewer-map-light.webp" dark="/screens/viewer-map-dark.webp" width="1440" height="900" alt="The architecture map of the crates directory: each crate is a box with its symbol and file counts, layered so that every crate sits above the crates it depends on." />

The map groups files into modules and lays them out by dependency: each module sits one layer above the modules it
depends on, so the foundations end up at the bottom and the entry points at the top. Line weight is how many calls,
imports and type references cross between two modules. Choose the folder and grouping depth on the right; **Copy
image** and **Download SVG** export the map as drawn.

## Dead code

<ScreenFigure src="/screens/viewer-dead-light.webp" dark="/screens/viewer-dead-dark.webp" width="1440" height="900" alt="The Dead code view: the symbols nothing in the index reaches, and on the right how many symbols with no incoming reference were left off the list, and why." />

Dead code lists symbols that nothing in the index reaches, largest first. The panel on the right explains what the
list leaves out and why: exported symbols, test files, symbols in component files whose markup can reach them, and
others. What remains has no static reference, which is not proof that it is unused: macros, trait objects and
reflection can still reach it.

## Start, entry points, screens and steps

The start page summarises the index: what it holds, the most depended-on symbols, where execution starts, and the
tests that reach furthest. **Entry points** lists those starting places in full, with saved trails first.

**Screens** and **Steps** need graph facts this version does not record yet: Screens reports that it found no screen
navigation, and Steps says it cannot draw steps. The [viewer reference](../reference/ui.md#differences-from-upstream)
lists what is still missing.

## Themes

The viewer follows your system's light or dark setting until you choose one with the theme control at the bottom of
the left rail. Below 600 px wide a tab bar replaces the rail, and the Symbol view shows one pane at a time.

## How it stays safe

The viewer listens on `127.0.0.1` only. It refuses requests whose `Host` or `Origin` is not its own, and writes that
lack its header. It opens only files the index names inside the project. The
[viewer reference](../reference/ui.md#boundary) lists every check.
