# Configuration

This page lists the settings that change what CodeGraph indexes and how it ranks results.

CodeGraph works without configuration. Settings live in two optional files inside the project's `.codegraph/`
directory, and a few environment variables tune the background process.

## `.codegraph/config.toml`

```toml
[app]
name = "my-project"

[indexing]
exclude = ["static/", "docs/generated/"]
deprioritize = ["vendor/**"]
```

When the file exists it must have an `[app]` table with a `name`; without it every command stops with a
`missing field` error. Every other setting is optional:

The project's `.gitignore` applies too: what Git ignores, CodeGraph does not index. A change to `config.toml` or to
the root `.gitignore` takes effect without a restart; run `codegraph sync` if no background process is running.

## `.codegraph/codegraph.json`

Map file extensions CodeGraph does not know to a language it parses:

```json
{
  "extensions": {
    ".blade": "php",
    ".x": "lua"
  }
}
```

Keys are matched without the leading dot and case-insensitively. A language name CodeGraph does not know is skipped,
and a malformed file is ignored with an error in the log rather than stopping indexing.

| `CODEGRAPH_NO_DAEMON=1`            | Run in the foreground and start no background process, for CI and scripts. |
| `CODEGRAPH_NO_WATCH=1`             | Keep the background process but stop it watching files.                    |
| `CODEGRAPH_WATCH_DEBOUNCE_MS`      | The watcher's pause, in milliseconds.                                      |
| `CODEGRAPH_DAEMON_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` | How long the background process stays after its last client leaves.        |
| `CODEGRAPH_MCP_TOOLS`              | Which MCP tools an agent sees in its tool list.                            |
| `CODEGRAPH_DIR`                    | Use another directory name inside the project instead of `.codegraph`.     |
| `CODEGRAPH_UI=1`                   | Turn on the browser viewer (preview).                                      |
