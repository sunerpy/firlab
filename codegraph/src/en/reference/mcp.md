# MCP Server Reference

`codegraph serve --mcp` runs a newline-delimited JSON-RPC MCP server over
stdin/stdout. It does **not** use LSP `Content-Length` framing.

Protocol handshake: `initialize` returns `serverInfo.name: "codegraph"`.
`serverInfo.version` reports the running binary's crate version (from
`CARGO_PKG_VERSION`), so it tracks releases automatically rather than being
hardcoded.

`protocolVersion` is negotiated, not fixed. The server is built on `rmcp` 3.5.0.

- **`initialize`.** It echoes back the revision the client asks for, as long as it
  is one it knows that has an `initialize` handshake: **2024-11-05**,
  **2025-03-26**, **2025-06-18** or **2025-11-25**.
- **2026-07-28.** This revision has no `initialize`. A 2026-07-28 client sends
  every request statelessly: the protocol version and client capabilities go in
  the request's `_meta` (`io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion`,
  `io.modelcontextprotocol/clientCapabilities`), alongside the SEP-2243 headers.
- **Fallback.** An `initialize` that asks for 2026-07-28 falls back to
  `2024-11-05`, like any unrecognized request.

What the revision changes:

| client sends                   | served at  | `resultType` in results | streamable-HTTP session          |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `initialize` for 2024-11-05    | 2024-11-05 | absent                  | no `Mcp-Session-Id` (our config) |
| `initialize` for 2025-03-26    | 2025-03-26 | absent                  | no `Mcp-Session-Id` (our config) |
| `initialize` for 2025-06-18    | 2025-06-18 | absent                  | no `Mcp-Session-Id` (our config) |
| `initialize` for 2025-11-25    | 2025-11-25 | absent                  | no `Mcp-Session-Id` (our config) |
| `initialize` for 2026-07-28    | 2024-11-05 | absent                  | no `Mcp-Session-Id` (our config) |
| a stateless 2026-07-28 request | 2026-07-28 | `"complete"`            | no `Mcp-Session-Id` (per spec)   |

Results carry the SEP-2322 discriminator `resultType: "complete"` only for a
2026-07-28 peer; older peers get the key stripped, and per spec a missing
`resultType` means `"complete"`. At 2026-07-28 the streamable-HTTP transport is
stateless (SEP-2567): no `Mcp-Session-Id`, no standalone GET/DELETE stream, no
`Last-Event-ID` resumption. At the four pre-2026 revisions the spec would allow a
session id, but this server is configured with legacy session mode off, so it
sends none there either: don't write session-resumption handling against it. Only
the cause differs — legacy statelessness is our configuration and could be
reversed, while 2026-07-28 statelessness is mandated and cannot. That transport also
validates the SEP-2243 standard headers — a request whose `MCP-Protocol-Version`
is missing, or whose `Mcp-Method`
or `Mcp-Name` disagrees with the body, is rejected with HTTP 400 and JSON-RPC
error code `-32020`.

The server advertises only the **tools** capability, and every tool call returns
a complete result; it never constructs the task or input-required response forms,
so Tasks (SEP-2663) and MRTR / elicitation-in-tool are not implemented.
Subscriptions are also unimplemented: the handler accepts no subscription filter,
and the legacy subscribe methods return method-not-found. Beyond the mandatory
`initialize` handshake — itself an inherited default, which is why version
negotiation happens automatically on top of our `get_info()` and why the
`2024-11-05` there is only a fallback — these inherited defaults also answer
successfully despite that narrow capability advertisement: discovery returns rmcp's known protocol versions plus this server's `get_info()`;
completion returns an empty default result; `prompts/list`, `resources/list`, and
`resources/templates/list` each return an empty list rather than an error, so
probing for prompts or resources gets a successful response with nothing in it;
and `ping` succeeds on the legacy revisions (it is method-not-found at
2026-07-28). None of these are our implementations — they are inherited SDK
defaults we do not override, and they add no advertised capability. Logging
`setLevel`, `prompts/get`, and `resources/read` return method-not-found.

## Quick-Register

Add to your agent's MCP config file, or run `codegraph install --yes` to write
it automatically:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codegraph": {
      "command": "codegraph",
      "args": ["serve", "--mcp"],
    },
  },
}
```

**Default (no `-p`):** `tools/list` always returns the full tool surface, even
before a project is resolved. When the server resolves a default project — the
working directory is at or inside an indexed project (find-up), an unindexed
workspace root contains exactly one indexed child, or the client sends
`rootUri`/`workspaceFolders`/`roots` — all tools work with `projectPath`
optional. When it cannot resolve one, tools are still listed but `projectPath`
is marked required in each tool's schema; the agent must then pass it per call.
Multiple indexed children are listed and never guessed. See
[Project resolution](#project-resolution) for the full three-case breakdown.
**Optional `-p <path>` / `--path <path>`:** pin the server to one fixed project
regardless of cwd (e.g.
`"args": ["serve", "--mcp", "-p", "/abs/path/to/project"]`).

Supported agents: Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, opencode, Hermes Agent,
Gemini CLI, Antigravity IDE, Kiro, Trae, Qoder, Zed, Zuno, VS Code
(GitHub Copilot), GitHub Copilot CLI, JetBrains IDEs (GitHub Copilot).

---

## Codex CLI — global and project-local config

Codex accepts the same TOML entry at two locations:

- global: `~/.codex/config.toml`, with managed instructions in
  `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`;
- local: `<project>/.codex/config.toml`, with managed instructions in the
  project-root `AGENTS.md` and the Skill in `.agents/skills/codegraph`.

Run `codegraph install --target=codex --local --yes` from the project root for
the local form. `--print-config=codex --local` prints the project snippet
without writing. Local uninstall removes only local CodeGraph markers/files and
does not touch the global entry. Codex disables project-layer configuration for
untrusted repositories, so mark the project trusted in Codex before expecting
the local MCP server to appear.

---

## Zuno — `mcp` config

Zuno uses an `mcp.<name>` wrapper and a string-array command:

```jsonc
{
  "mcp": {
    "codegraph": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["codegraph", "serve", "--mcp"],
      "enabled": true,
    },
  },
}
```

Run `codegraph install --target=zuno --global` for
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zuno/zuno.json[c]` (normally
`~/.config/zuno/zuno.json[c]`), or `--local` for
`.zuno/zuno.json[c]`. Existing JSONC comments and sibling MCP entries are
preserved. A pre-existing `mcp.codegraph-mcp-server` entry is migrated to the
canonical `mcp.codegraph` key.

The installer also manages only the fenced CodeGraph block in Zuno's
`AGENTS.md`: global `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zuno/AGENTS.md`, or the project-root
`AGENTS.md` for a local install. `codegraph skill update --target=zuno` refreshes
that block together with the shared `.agents/skills/codegraph/SKILL.md`.

---

## Zed — `context_servers` config

Zed uses a different MCP config shape than other agents. Instead of `mcpServers`,
it uses a `context_servers` key, and the entry has **no `type` field**:

```jsonc
{
  "context_servers": {
    "codegraph": {
      "command": "codegraph",
      "args": ["serve", "--mcp"],
      "env": {},
    },
  },
}
```

**Global vs. project-level path constraint.** Zed's global user settings
(`~/.config/zed/settings.json` on Linux and macOS; `%APPDATA%\Zed\settings.json`
on Windows) cannot inject a per-project `--path` — there is no `${workspaceFolder}`
expansion in Zed's `context_servers` args. A global entry therefore runs
read-only off whatever index the working directory resolves to.

To pin a project's server to an absolute path and get live per-project indexing,
run `codegraph init --target=zed` inside the project. This writes a
**project-level** `.zed/settings.json` with the absolute `--path` baked in:

```jsonc
{
  "context_servers": {
    "codegraph": {
      "command": "codegraph",
      "args": ["serve", "--mcp", "--path", "/absolute/path/to/project"],
      "env": {},
    },
  },
}
```

This is the **only** way to give Zed a per-project path. Without it the server
falls back to home safe mode if Zed's CWD cannot find an indexed project via
find-up.

Run `codegraph install --target=zed` to write the bare global entry, or
`codegraph init --target=zed` inside a project to write the project-level entry.

### Zed over SSH (remote development)

**Symptom.** You open a remote SSH project in Zed (Zed UI on your local machine,
code and `.codegraph/` index on a remote Linux host). All codegraph MCP tools
return empty — "No relevant code found" — even after the index built successfully.

**Root cause.** Zed currently executes `context_servers` entries on the **local
machine**, not on the remote host. This is true even when a remote SSH project is
open: the `command: "codegraph"` runs locally, cannot reach the remote
`.codegraph/` index, and returns nothing. Native remote MCP execution — running
the server on the remote host — is not yet implemented in Zed (tracked in Zed's
GitHub issues; status as of mid-2026).

**Recommended fix — streamable-HTTP over a forwarded port.** Run the MCP server
on the remote host with the HTTP transport, forward its port through SSH, and give
Zed a `url` instead of a `command`. Zed then talks to a local port that SSH pipes
to the remote server, so the process reading the index runs where the index lives.

On the **remote** host:

```bash
codegraph serve --http --detach --path /abs/path/to/project
```

`--http` binds `127.0.0.1:8111` by default (override with
`--http-addr <host>:<port>`); `--detach` runs it in the background and prints its
pid and log path. `codegraph http list` shows running servers and
`codegraph http stop 127.0.0.1:8111` terminates one. With `--path`, the project
must already be indexed — run `codegraph init /abs/path/to/project` first.

Forward the port from your **local** machine:

```bash
ssh -N -L 8111:127.0.0.1:8111 <your-ssh-host-alias>
```

Then in `.zed/settings.json` on the **local** machine:

```jsonc
{
  "context_servers": {
    "codegraph": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8111/mcp",
    },
  },
}
```

**Why forward rather than expose the port.** The default bind is loopback-only,
so nothing is reachable from the network — the SSH tunnel is what makes the remote
server visible, and it makes the endpoint genuinely _local_ from Zed's point of
view. That matters because MCP hosts commonly permit plain `http` only for
localhost and require `https` for anything remote (Kiro enforces exactly this).
Forwarding keeps you on the localhost side of that rule without terminating TLS.

`codegraph install --target=zed` writes this HTTP entry into your `settings.json`
as a `//`-commented alternative next to the active stdio entry, marked RECOMMENDED
for remote — uncomment it rather than typing it out.

**Fallback — SSH stdio bridge.** If you cannot forward a port, make Zed's local
`command` be `ssh` into the remote host and run codegraph there. SSH proxies
stdin/stdout transparently, so the MCP JSON-RPC stream flows through the tunnel
without any change to the codegraph binary itself.

In your project's `.zed/settings.json` on the **local** machine:

```jsonc
{
  "context_servers": {
    "codegraph": {
      "command": "ssh",
      "args": [
        "-T",
        "<your-ssh-host-alias>",
        "cd /abs/path/to/project && /abs/path/to/codegraph serve --mcp --path /abs/path/to/project",
      ],
      "env": {},
    },
  },
}
```

**Why each part matters:**

- `command: "ssh"` — runs on the local machine (satisfying Zed's
  "MCP runs locally" constraint) while the actual codegraph process runs on the
  remote host and reads the remote index.
- `-T` — disables PTY allocation. Without it, SSH allocates a pseudo-terminal
  whose control sequences corrupt the MCP JSON-RPC byte stream.
- `<your-ssh-host-alias>` — use the host alias from your local `~/.ssh/config`
  (e.g. `code-server`). An alias lets you keep key/port/ProxyJump options out of
  this config and reuse an existing entry.
- Absolute path to codegraph — a non-login SSH shell may not source
  `~/.cargo/env`, so `~/.cargo/bin` is often absent from `PATH`. Use the full
  path to the binary (e.g. `/config/.cargo/bin/codegraph` or wherever you
  installed it on the remote host).
- `--path /abs/path/to/project` — pins the server to the right project
  explicitly, so resolution never depends on the remote cwd or the MCP roots
  handshake over the tunnel.

**Bridge caveats.** Each Zed window opens a fresh SSH session (the shared daemon is
not reused across them), so startup is slightly slower than a local connection. The
remote codegraph daemon does still run for the duration of that session and serves
queries normally. The HTTP transport avoids this — one detached server handles every
window — which is why it is the recommended path. Both are stopgaps until Zed ships
native remote MCP support.

## Default vs. Full Tool Set

`tools/list` surfaces only the **4 default tools** by default
(`explore`, `node`, `search`, `callers` — the `DEFAULT_MCP_TOOLS` set). All 10
tools remain callable via `tools/call`. To expose additional tools in `tools/list`,
set the `CODEGRAPH_MCP_TOOLS` environment variable to a comma-separated list of
short names, e.g.:

```bash
CODEGRAPH_MCP_TOOLS=explore,node,search,callers,impact,check codegraph serve --mcp
```

---

## All 10 Tools

| Tool                | Purpose                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `codegraph_explore` | PRIMARY tool: blast radius + relationship map + dynamic-dispatch boundaries + source blocks (output is size-adaptive to project scale). |
| `codegraph_search`  | FTS5 + multi-signal scored symbol search.                                                                                               |
| `codegraph_node`    | Node detail (symbol view) or file view (line-numbered source). A smarter `Read`.                                                        |
| `codegraph_callers` | Callers of a symbol (along calls/references/imports edges).                                                                             |
| `codegraph_callees` | Targets a symbol calls.                                                                                                                 |
| `codegraph_impact`  | Blast radius of changing a symbol (transitive incoming deps).                                                                           |
| `codegraph_status`  | Index status summary (files/nodes/edges/DB size/stale files).                                                                           |
| `codegraph_files`   | List/tree indexed files under a path.                                                                                                   |
| `codegraph_check`   | Circular-dependency detection. Returns each cycle as `a.ts -> b.ts -> a.ts`.                                                            |
| `codegraph_export`  | Whole-graph NetworkX node-link JSON export with optional PageRank centrality.                                                           |

Every tool is query-only, so each carries MCP tool **annotations** in
`tools/list` — `readOnlyHint: true`, `destructiveHint: false`,
`idempotentHint: true`, `openWorldHint: false`. Hosts that respect these hints
can call codegraph tools freely without write-confirmation prompts. The hint
describes the caller's environment: a tool never writes a source file or any
path outside the project's index directory. The first call with an explicit
`projectPath` may start that project's shared daemon and bring its
**existing** derived index up to date (see the explicit-project lifecycle
below); that is cache maintenance inside `.codegraph/`, never the creation of
an index or a change to user files, so the hint stays `true`.

---

## Tool Usage Notes

**`codegraph_explore`** is the primary entry point for agent queries. One call
returns the symbols relevant to a query, their verbatim source grouped by file,
plus the call/impact graph around them. Prefer it over individual `callers`/
`callees` chains when surveying an unfamiliar area.

Explicit source paths in the query are resolved before fuzzy search and pinned
to the front of the result. Quoted/backticked paths, `./`, and Windows
separators are normalized; exact matches precede segment-aligned suffix
matches. Extensionless kebab basenames are accepted only when they resolve to at
most three indexed files, so ordinary hyphenated prose remains prose. When a
path or basename matches several files and the query also names symbols in a
code shape (camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case, `$` or qualified), only the
matches defining one of them are pinned, and the summary names the files set
aside; a basename shared by more than three files resolves the same way when
the named symbols narrow it to three or fewer. The
resolver examines at most eight path spans, drops at most eight leading
segments, pins at most eight files (also bounded by `maxFiles`), and reports at
most four unresolved explicit paths. Resolved or clearly missing explicit paths
are removed from the normal query, preventing route parameters and basenames
from becoming noisy symbol seeds. Pinned files survive low-score filtering and
receive a protected source budget.

Line references on a path that resolved to exactly one file are kept as
anchors: `compiler.py:776`, `foo.ts:12-40`, `foo.ts#L88-L120`, and prose ranges
bound to the nearest such path (`compiler.py lines 900-1003`,
`L900-L1003 in compiler.py`, `lines 900 to 1003`). A bare number counts only
after `line`/`lines` or directly after the path, and numbers above 1,000,000
are ignored. A single-line anchor selects the innermost method, function, or
component enclosing it; a range, or a line no callable encloses (with 15 lines
either side), renders as that span. Those, and a qualified name
(`SQLCompiler.as_sql`, `Engine::ServeHTTP`) with at most three non-test
definitions, are **exact targets**: they lead the blast radius, their files rank
ahead of incidental files, and their clusters render first. An exact body is
returned whole when it fits the file's budget, and otherwise from its own head
plus windows on the anchored line and on its calls into the other symbols the
query names. A named neighbour that no longer fits beside it is listed in the
file header instead.

Each file's source is held to a per-file ceiling of 1.5 × the tier's per-file
budget. A file the query names (by path, by an exact target, or by a symbol it
defines) that this ceiling clipped is rendered again into whatever budget the
rest of the response left unspent, so a question about one file can use the
whole response while every other file keeps exactly the section it was given.

Explore also resolves prose and camelCase query segments against indexed symbol
names, then merges the resulting callable, Variable, and Constant names as
dampened exact seeds. This recovers names such as `feedAtBottom` from "feed
bottom" while keeping ordinary `codegraph_search` on its fast SQL/FTS path.

The blast-radius block that `explore` prints reports **measured** test coverage.
When no test file calls a root directly, codegraph walks UP the caller graph
before saying anything — up to 3 hops (direct callers are hop 1), bounded by 64
caller lookups per root. The three outcomes, verbatim:

| Outcome                                | Suffix                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| A test was reached through callers     | ``; tested via callers: `f1`, `f2` +N`` |
| Nothing found, budget survived         | `; no tests found within 3 caller hops` |
| Nothing found, lookup budget exhausted | `; no test calls this directly`         |

At most two test file names are shown; the `+N` tail counts the rest. The
traversal frontier itself is uncapped, so the display cap never hides a hop.
Neither not-found form carries a warning glyph any more: the note states what was
searched instead of implying the symbol is untested, which for anything reached
through a helper it usually was not.

**`codegraph_node`** accepts a symbol name, qualified name, exact node ID (for
example, `node.id` from CLI `codegraph search --json`), or a file path. `file`
and `line` can pin an overloaded symbol to one definition. When given a file
path without a symbol it returns the file's source with line numbers, which is a
more accurate alternative to a plain `Read` tool call.

File mode also accepts pasted editor/GitHub locations: `src/app.ts:42`,
`src/app.ts:42-80`, `src/app.ts#L42`, and `src/app.ts#L42-L80` (the final `L` is
optional). Resolution tries the literal indexed filename first; only a literal
miss may strip a valid positive selector. A single line supplies the default
`offset`; a closed range supplies the default inclusive `limit`. Explicit MCP
`offset` and `limit` fields override the suffix independently, so
`{"file":"src/app.ts:42-80","offset":5,"limit":2}` reads lines 5–6. Invalid,
zero, reversed, overflowing, and ambiguous Windows-drive spellings stay literal.

**`codegraph_callers`**, **`codegraph_callees`**, and **`codegraph_impact`** do
not silently merge unrelated same-named definitions. Results are grouped by
`(filePath, qualifiedName)`; same-definition overloads stay together, while two
apps that each define `handle` get separate sections/blast radii. Pass `file`
with an exact project-relative path or suffix to select one definition. A
non-matching filter is disclosed and falls back to all definitions instead of
returning a misleading empty result. Caller/callee limits apply per definition;
when a cap hides rows, the response reports `Showing N of M` and tells the host
to widen `limit` (up to 100).

**`codegraph_impact`** returns the transitive incoming dependency set — every
symbol that would break if the queried symbol changed. Use it before a refactor
to understand the blast radius instead of walking callers manually.

**`codegraph_check`** returns cycles as ordered lists of file paths. It's
additive: most projects have zero cycles; run it after a large dependency
restructuring to confirm no new cycles were introduced.

**`codegraph_status`** appends a `Pending sync` section when the current source
scope differs from the persisted file inventory. It sees committed-but-unindexed
work as well as working-tree and non-Git changes, applies the same project scope
and content-hash gates as whole-tree sync, and lists each added/modified/removed
path. The check is read-only and holds the engine's existing shared index lease.
In a git work tree it takes the same git fast path as `codegraph status`, and it
falls back to the full inventory under the same conditions.

**`codegraph_export`** dumps the complete graph as NetworkX node-link JSON.
Useful for external visualization tools, custom analysis scripts, or feeding an
LLM a high-level structural summary of the entire codebase.

## Error Channels

Two distinct error channels:

- **Unknown tool name** — JSON-RPC error `-32602` (invalid params).
- **Missing or invalid required argument** — tool result with
  `{content: ..., isError: true}` and `Error: <message>` body.

---

## Daemon & live watch

When the project is indexed (`.codegraph/` exists), `serve --mcp` does not run
inline. Instead it spawns — or proxies to — a single shared detached daemon
process per project. Multiple agent clients (e.g. Claude Code + Cursor open
simultaneously) all attach to the same daemon, so the index is loaded and
maintained once.

The daemon runs a file watcher (`codegraph-watch`) that live-reindexes changed
files. Events are debounced (default ~2 s; tunable via
`CODEGRAPH_WATCH_DEBOUNCE_MS`) so a burst of saves triggers one incremental
rebuild rather than many. The watcher is auto-disabled on WSL2 `/mnt/` drives
where recursive watch is too slow; set `CODEGRAPH_FORCE_WATCH=1` to override.
The selected index root's `config.toml` and `codegraph.json`, plus the project
root `.gitignore`, are live control files: their events bypass ordinary
include/exclude filtering, reload the running scope, reconcile OS watch targets,
and trigger one full scan that supersedes queued path deltas. Invalid TOML keeps
the last valid scope and is reported; malformed JSON keeps the existing tolerant
empty-override semantics. Every later incremental sync re-checks the current
scope, preventing stale events from re-admitting excluded files.
Ranking-only `deprioritize` rules are loaded separately from watcher scope.
Each request-scoped engine loads the addressed project's JSON rules followed by
its authoritative TOML rules, so a long-lived stdio or HTTP process observes
edits on its next search/explore request without changing the graph.

Exactly one process owns background writes for each indexed project. Besides the
short-lived `index.lock` leases taken by individual mutations, the daemon holds an
OS kernel exclusive lock on `.codegraph/writer.pid` for its whole watcher/catch-up
lifetime. The file's JSON is diagnostic; process death releases the kernel lock
without trusting PID reuse or deleting/recreating the authority path. On a cold
daemon start, the foreground stdio process answers the first handshake directly
but starts no second watcher. When `CODEGRAPH_NO_DAEMON=1` is used, the foreground
process owns this writer lock; a second direct server for the same project exits
with actionable guidance. Read-only/no-default sessions take no writer lock.
When the resolved root is exactly `$HOME` or the filesystem root (`/`), the
server first disables the daemon, the file watcher, AND catch-up sync — not just
the watcher. This happens when an IDE or agent (e.g. Kiro) launches
`codegraph serve --mcp` with no `--path` and its CWD is the home directory;
without the guard, the server would spawn a daemon that indexes the entire home
tree and peg a CPU at 99%. In this initial safe mode the server still answers the
handshake, but it will not start background services against `$HOME`. If the
client advertises MCP roots support, the server sends `roots/list`, adopts the
first indexed root from the client's response, starts or attaches to that root's
shared project daemon, then proxies the current stdio session to that daemon.
That lets a single global config recover the real project even when the launch
CWD was home, without hardcoding `--path`. `CODEGRAPH_FORCE_WATCH` does **not**
override this guard (it only overrides the WSL2 `/mnt/` disable). A real project
nested under `$HOME` (e.g. `~/projects/myapp`) is unaffected and gets the full
daemon, watcher, and catch-up. To guarantee per-project services for clients that
do not support roots, pin the root via `--path <project>` in the client's MCP
config args (e.g. a workspace-level `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`), or open the
project folder as the working directory.

For a normal unindexed workspace container, stdio startup has one additional
safe path before entering no-default mode: if the launch directory has a
workspace manifest or `.git`, CodeGraph scans downward to depth 4, inspects at
most 64 indexed candidates, skips dot/heavy/build/vendor/venv/cache/temp
directories, and stops below an indexed child. Exactly one candidate is adopted
and gets the full daemon/watcher/catch-up lifecycle. Zero or multiple candidates
are never guessed. This scan is forbidden at `$HOME` and filesystem roots.

Multiple indexed children do not need duplicate MCP registrations. On the first
tool call that supplies an explicit `projectPath`, CodeGraph starts or attaches
that **existing** project's shared daemon, retains one connection for the MCP
session, and waits for a whole-project catch-up before executing the tool. Later
saves are handled by that daemon's single watcher. A second MCP session reuses
the same daemon; closing either session drops only its retained connection, so
the other keeps live sync active. Each session retains at most 32 explicit
projects. A retained service is re-checked on every call: if its daemon has
exited, or the project's index was removed or re-created since the service
attached, the stale connection is released and the next call attaches and
catches up again instead of answering without live synchronization. This never
creates an index, selects a default, or eagerly watches all discovered
children. `CODEGRAPH_NO_DAEMON=1` explicitly opts out of this lazy daemon-backed
lifecycle; `--no-watch` still permits the first catch-up but disables later
file watching. Streamable HTTP global/no-path mode does not adopt a cwd child;
because HTTP requests carry no session, one explicit-project service broker is
shared by the whole server process, so the 32-project bound and the retained
connections last until the server exits.

## Project resolution

`tools/list` **always** returns the full default tool surface (4 tools by
default, or the `CODEGRAPH_MCP_TOOLS` allowlist). What changes depending on
whether a default project was resolved is which tool parameters are required:

- **`projectPath` optional** — the server resolved a default project. Tools just
  work with no per-call path argument.
- **`projectPath` required** — no default project was resolved. Tools are still
  listed, but the schema marks `projectPath` required on every tool so the
  agent knows to supply it per call. You can also pin a single project with
  `-p`/`--path` instead.

The stdio server resolves a default project from these sources:

1. **`--path` flag** — explicit pin; always wins.
2. **find-up from cwd** — ascends from the working directory to the nearest
   `.codegraph/` index root. A cwd at or inside an indexed project resolves it
   here, and `projectPath` is optional.
3. **bounded workspace child scan** — if find-up yields nothing and the launch
   directory contains `.git` or a workspace manifest, scan at most four levels
   and 64 candidates. Exactly one indexed child is adopted; multiple candidates
   are sorted and reported, never selected. HOME and filesystem roots are not
   scanned.
4. **MCP `initialize` handshake** — if startup resolution yields nothing, the server reads
   the `initialize` message sent by the client and adopts the workspace it
   advertises (`rootUri`, `rootPath`, or `workspaceFolders[0].uri`) — provided
   that path is already indexed. If the client does not include those fields but
   advertises `capabilities.roots`, the server sends a `roots/list` request and
   adopts the first indexed root from the response.

If all sources yield nothing, the server serves the full tool list with
`projectPath` marked required. This is the case for roots-less clients that use
a fixed launch directory not inside any project — for example, 通义灵码/Lingma
configured with a single global MCP entry whose working directory is the home
directory. In that scenario the tools are listed and the agent can still call
them by passing an explicit `projectPath`; for single-project setups, pinning
`-p /path/to/project` in the MCP config args is the simpler alternative.

With no default, a tool call that omits `projectPath` returns normal
success-shaped text explaining the remedies. If the child scan found several
indexes, that text and stderr list the sorted candidates. A caller-supplied
absolute `projectPath` is authoritative and bypasses the ambiguity; an explicit
path that does not resolve remains an `isError` tool result. The cheap upward
probe runs again on relevant requests, while the downward scan is throttled to
once per five seconds so a project initialized after server startup can be
adopted without walking the workspace on every call.

For an explicit path that **does** resolve to an existing index, the first call
is also the live-service boundary: it waits for catch-up and retains that
project's shared daemon/watcher as described above. Query routing therefore does
not imply default selection, while synchronization no longer depends on having a
default project.

> **Note:** the home-directory / filesystem-root guard (see [Daemon & live watch]

The daemon exits automatically after all clients disconnect and an idle timeout
elapses. Logs are appended to `.codegraph/daemon.log`. A stale lock (e.g. after
a crash) can be cleared with `codegraph unlock`.

On Unix, the detached daemon calls `setsid` to become a session leader, so when
the short-lived proxy that spawned it exits the daemon is reparented to `init`
and reaped automatically — no `<defunct>` zombie appears in the process table.
The daemon exits when its real host (the IDE or agent running `serve --mcp`)
dies, detected via `host_pid` liveness; raw parent-pid divergence is not used
for this check because a deliberately daemonized process legitimately reparents
to `init`.

To disable the daemon entirely and run the MCP server in the foreground, set
`CODEGRAPH_NO_DAEMON=1`. Run only one such writer per indexed project; additional
clients should leave daemon mode enabled and proxy to the shared process. For the
full set of env-var knobs — timeouts, sweep intervals, watch settings — see
[`docs/cli.md`](cli.md).

## Claude prompt-hook (confidence-tiered gate)

`codegraph install --prompt-hook` writes a Claude Code `UserPromptSubmit` hook
that pipes each user prompt into `codegraph prompt-hook` on stdin. Claude sends a
JSON payload — `{prompt, cwd}` (the `"prompt"`/`"cwd"` object) — so the hook reads
`.prompt` as the query and resolves the project from `.cwd` (falling back to
`--path`, then the process cwd). A raw-string argument or raw-string stdin still
works for direct invocation (`codegraph prompt-hook "how does X work"`).

The hook is a **three-tier confidence gate** — it decides not just _whether_ to
inject context but _how much_:

- **Structural question or named symbol → full context.** A structural /
  flow / impact / "where-how" question in any of ~29 covered languages (across
  Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, CJK, Hangul, Arabic, Hebrew, Thai, and Devanagari
  scripts), OR a code-shaped token (`getUserId`, `get_user`, `Counter()`,
  `user.login`) that is verified as a real symbol in the index, runs
  `codegraph_explore` and injects its full output (capped at 9,000 UTF-8 bytes,
  leaving wrapper headroom under Claude Code's 10,000-byte inline limit).
- **Plain words matching indexed symbols → short hint.** When the prompt has no
  structural keyword or verified token but its prose words match indexed
  symbol-name segments (e.g. `checkout state machine` → `CheckoutStateMachine`),
  the hook injects a short **pointer** naming the matching symbols and letting the
  agent write the explore query itself — it never runs explore, so a fuzzy match
  can't flood the prompt with the wrong feature's source.
- **Everything else → silent.** Ordinary prose (`please fix this typo`) is a
  zero-cost **silent no-op** — nothing is printed.

The gate is a pure, deterministic function of the prompt plus the current
indexed node-name set: the plain-words tier is derived at query time from the
existing symbol names (no extra table, no schema change), and there is **no
telemetry or tracking of any kind**. Set `CODEGRAPH_NO_PROMPT_HOOK=1` (or
`CODEGRAPH_PROMPT_HOOK=0`) to disable the hook without editing the config. Every
failure path — kill-switch, non-matching prompt, no index, engine error — exits 0
with no output; the hook is degradable by contract and never breaks the prompt.
Host-generated task completions are also discarded before classification when
their first non-whitespace content is `<task-notification>`; the same text later
inside a real user discussion does not match that anchored gate.

## Stale Index Warning

The index typically lags file writes by ~1 second when the daemon is running. In
that window a file's stored line ranges can point at the wrong bytes, so every
tool that emits source first checks the file it is about to read.

### What counts as drift

A referenced file is compared against its stored record before its text is used.
Freshness is fail-closed: **proven fresh** is an earned state, not the default:

1. **The file record loads and size + millisecond mtime match** → proven fresh,
   no hashing. This is the same fast path `codegraph sync` uses.
2. **Stat mismatch** → the file's sha256 content hash is computed and compared.
   A matching indexed hash also proves freshness; a hash mismatch is possibly
   drifted.

Every outcome that cannot prove either condition is **possibly drifted**: the
file record is absent or unreadable, the source read fails, or an oversized file
has a stat mismatch. Oversized files are never read or hashed, so only their
size + millisecond mtime fast path can prove freshness.

So a `touch`, or a rewrite that produces identical bytes, is not drift — the
hash check absorbs it. The probe is memoized per tool call, so one `explore` never
stats the same file twice.

### A drifted file ships whole or not at all

Stored line numbers are unsafe once the bytes moved, so codegraph will not slice a
drifted file at them. Instead:

- **`codegraph_node`** on a symbol in a drifted file emits the file's full
  **current** source when it fits under the 2000-line whole-file cap
  (`FILE_MODE_MAX_LINES`, the same ceiling normal file mode uses). Over the cap,
  the body is omitted with a notice; the location and signature are still shown,
  flagged as possibly shifted.
- **`codegraph_explore`** flags a drifted file and disables adaptive, skeleton,
  and cluster slicing for it. Whole-file rendering is correct by construction, so
  a small file still comes back in full; a large one is omitted rather than
  sliced.

Byte size stays gated separately by `indexing.max_file_size` (1 MiB default) —
a file over that limit was never extracted, so its text is not served either way.

### The banner

A response is prefixed with:

```
⚠️ Some files referenced below were edited since the last index sync — their codegraph entries may be stale:
  - path/to/file.rs
For accurate content of those specific files, Read them directly. The rest of this response is fresh.
```

only when that response actually serves or cites current bytes from a
possibly-drifted file. An unreadable or oversized file whose content is omitted
is still not treated as fresh, but it does **not** fabricate a banner entry for
bytes the response never exposed. A response with no cited possibly-drifted bytes
gets **no** banner, which is what makes "trust everything not listed" a real
guarantee rather than an assumption — the agent instructions had described this
banner before anything produced it. Run `codegraph sync`, or wait for the watcher,
if you see it on a hot codebase; ordinary drift does not require a full rebuild.

### Auto-sync health

When the server runs the project's live watcher in-process, every answer also
reports its health, since edits the index never heard about cannot reach the
per-file banner above:

- **RECOVERING** — another process held the index past the sync's contention
  budget (a long foreground `index`). Watching continues and changes are still
  collected; a full reconcile is retried every 30 s, and until one commits each
  response starts with `⚠️ CodeGraph auto-sync is RECOVERING …`.
- **DISABLED** — watching stopped (watch resources exhausted, or syncs failing
  persistently). Responses start with `⚠️ CodeGraph auto-sync is DISABLED …` and
  the reason; run `codegraph sync` and restart the server.

In either state `codegraph_search`, `codegraph_callers`, `codegraph_callees`
and `codegraph_impact` check every indexed file they would name against disk,
and when one changed or disappeared since its last sync they name those files
instead of answering from the frozen graph. `codegraph_status` reports the
state as `Auto-sync:`.
