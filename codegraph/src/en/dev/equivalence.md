# CodeGraph Rust Equivalence Oracle

This document defines the byte-level and semantic parity contract between the
Rust port and the pinned upstream TypeScript reference. The current authoritative
fixture is `crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/mini/`; the live reference outputs are
stored under `reference/golden/mini/`.

The complete committed corpus registry is the set of directories under
`reference/golden/`. Extraction corpora contain canonical `nodes.json`,
`edges.json`, `refs.json`, `files.json`, and `schema.sql`; `mcp/` contains
structural protocol fixtures. Do not maintain an unchecked fixed corpus count in
this document—tests enumerate the committed directories and recipes below.

## Node ID Formula

The symbol-node helper computes:

```text
sha256("{filePath}:{kind}:{name}:{line}") -> hex -> first 32 chars
id = "{kind}:{hash32}"
```

Rust mirrors this in `codegraph_core::node_id::generate_node_id()`.

Inputs are part of the compatibility contract:

- `filePath`: project-relative path with `/` separators, for example
  `src/app.ts`.
- `kind`: the serialized `NodeKind::as_str()` value, for example `function`,
  `class`, `method`, or `import`.
- `name`: the exact extracted name. Import nodes use the module specifier, for
  example `./math`.
- `line`: 1-based start line. The tree-sitter call site passes
  `node.startPosition.row + 1`.

Same-kind, same-name declarations on one line (a getter/setter pair) hash to
the same id. Since extraction version 15 the first one, in extraction order,
keeps it, and every later declaration at a different column appends
`:{column}`, its zero-based UTF-16 column — the column unit upstream uses, not
tree-sitter's byte column (`NodeIdAllocator`, upstream #1349). Revisiting the
same declaration yields the same id, so a declaration that collides with
nothing keeps exactly the id above.

## File Node Special Case

Tree-sitter file nodes do not call `generateNodeId()`. The tree-sitter file-node special case uses the literal ID:

```text
file:{filePath}
```

The mini golden data verifies this for all three file nodes, for example
`file:src/app.ts`. Non-file nodes in the same golden set, including imports, use
the hashed `{kind}:{32hex}` form.

Some custom extractors call `generateNodeId(..., 'file', ..., 1)` for their own
file-like nodes; that is a separate custom-extractor path and is not the
tree-sitter file node represented in the mini golden.

## Content Hash Formula

The content hash (`hashContent`)
stores a full lowercase SHA-256 hex digest of the file content in
`files.content_hash`.

Rust mirrors this in `codegraph_core::node_id::hash_content()`. The test fixture
hashes are cross-checked against:

```bash
sqlite3 reference/golden/mini/colby.db \
  "select path,content_hash from files order by path;"
```

## Oracle Tiers

### Tier-1: Byte-identical

Tier-1 fields must match the reference output byte-for-byte and are allowed to
fail tests on any mismatch:

- `nodes` rows, excluding inherently time-varying `updated_at`.
- Node IDs, including the `file:{path}` tree-sitter file-node special case.
- `files.content_hash` values.
- SQLite schema and FTS5 schema/triggers/indexes captured from `.schema`.

### Tier-2: Multiset-identical

Tier-2 data may be compared as unordered multisets when insertion order or rowid
allocation is not semantically stable:

- `edges` keyed by `(source, target, kind)` plus relevant metadata.
- `unresolved_refs` keyed by `(from_node_id, reference_name, reference_kind)` and
  source location.

### Tier-3: Allowlisted behavioral parity

Tier-3 output can differ only when the difference is intentionally documented in
`KNOWN_DIFFS.md`:

- Query output formatting.
- MCP response formatting and summaries.
- Other presentation-layer or non-deterministic fields that preserve semantics.

## Determinism Statement

Node IDs are Tier-1 deterministic. Given the same relative path, serialized
`NodeKind`, extracted name, and 1-based start line, Rust must produce exactly the
same bytes as the reference. The golden test in `crates/codegraph-core/src/node_id.rs`
loads all 13 real nodes from `reference/golden/mini/colby.nodes.json` and proves
that every ID reproduces.

## Harness

The executable oracle lives in `crates/codegraph-bench/src/oracle/` and is the
library entry point for later cross-implementation runs. Later tasks should call:

```rust
codegraph_bench::oracle::assert_equivalent(rust_db, golden_dir)
```

For the current mini fixture:

```bash
cargo test -p codegraph-bench --test equivalence -- --nocapture
```

### Regenerating goldens

Canonical fixture files are committed under `reference/golden/<corpus>/`:

- `nodes.json`
- `edges.json`
- `refs.json`
- `files.json`
- `schema.sql`

Regenerate from a reference SQLite database with:

```bash
cargo run -p codegraph-bench --bin bench -- \
  --gen-golden reference/golden/mini/colby.db reference/golden/mini
```

The canonicalizer strips inherently unstable timestamp columns
(`nodes.updated_at`, `files.modified_at`, `files.indexed_at`), parses JSON text
columns before re-serializing them with deterministic key order, asserts all
stored paths are relative `/` paths, ignores `edges.id` and
`unresolved_refs.id`, and normalizes `.schema` text with the same rules used by
`crates/codegraph-store/tests/schema_parity.rs`.

### Godot fixture

A second golden fixture, `reference/golden/godot/`, guards Godot-specific
extraction that the mini fixture cannot reach — there are no `.gd`/`.tscn`/
`project.godot` files in `mini`. It captures the framework-resolver output for:

- **F1** — an autoload call (`GameFlow.return_to_map()`) resolving to the unique
  same-named `func` in the bound script (a `framework`-resolved `Calls` edge),
  alongside the coexisting singleton-constant edge.
- **F2** — signal-handler connections (`.connect(_on_pressed.bind(button))` and
  `.connect(Callable(self, "_on_input"))`) resolving to the handler `func`s
  (`Calls` edges).
- **F3** — a `.tscn` `ExtResource` script attachment (`main.tscn` →
  `stage_manager.gd`), captured as a `script_attach` unresolved-ref subkind.
- **UID-form autoloads** — a sidecar-UID SCRIPT autoload
  (`EffectManager="*uid://…"` resolved through `effect_manager.gd.uid` →
  `effect_manager.gd`, with an `EffectManager.apply_effect()` F1 method edge) and
  a header-UID SCENE autoload (`ComboUi="*uid://…"` resolved through
  `combo_ui.tscn`'s `uid=` header, registration-only). Both emit an
  `Autoload`-subkind UNRESOLVED ref; the `.gd.uid` sidecar is NOT indexed (it maps
  to `Language::Unknown`, so it is neither a file record nor a node).

The minimal source corpus lives at `crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/godot/`
(`project.godot`, `game_flow.gd`, `stage_manager.gd`, `main.tscn`,
`effect_manager.gd`, `effect_manager.gd.uid`, `combo_ui.tscn`).

Regenerate the committed database + canonical JSON reproducibly from the corpus:

```bash
# 1. Copy the corpus to a clean directory (keeps the workspace index out of it).
rm -rf /tmp/cg-fixture-godot
cp -r crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/godot /tmp/cg-fixture-godot

# 2. Index it with OUR binary (never hand-write the golden).
cargo build --release -p codegraph-rs
CODEGRAPH_NO_DAEMON=1 CODEGRAPH_NO_WATCH=1 \
  ./target/release/codegraph init /tmp/cg-fixture-godot

# 3. Commit the produced database as the fixture's colby.db.
cp /tmp/cg-fixture-godot/.codegraph/codegraph.db reference/golden/godot/colby.db

# 4. Dump the canonical golden JSON + schema from that database.
cargo run -p codegraph-bench --bin bench -- \
  --gen-golden reference/golden/godot/colby.db reference/golden/godot
```

The extraction and `--gen-golden` steps are both byte-stable: re-running the
index or the dump reproduces identical `nodes.json`/`edges.json`/`refs.json`/
`files.json`/`schema.sql`. The `generated_golden_matches_committed_godot_fixture`
and `upstream_db_is_self_equivalent_to_godot_golden` tests in
`crates/codegraph-bench/tests/equivalence.rs` enforce this.

Two properties this recipe does NOT claim, for every fixture below as well:

- **`colby.db` is not byte-reproducible.** SQLite's header carries a change
  counter, so a freshly indexed database differs from the committed one in the
  first page even when every row matches. Only the `--gen-golden` artifacts are
  compared byte-for-byte; the `.db` is an input to that dump, not a golden.
- **`schema.sql` records `.schema` statement ORDER, which can shift.** The order
  reflects how the current binary creates its objects. Regenerating a fixture
  whose committed `schema.sql` was produced by an earlier binary can therefore
  reorder statements (e.g. `idx_edges_identity`) with no schema change. Always
  regenerate `schema.sql` from the database you are committing — steps 3 and 4
  do exactly that, which keeps the pair self-consistent — and review an
  order-only diff as expected rather than as drift.

The schema normalization helper is replicated inside `codegraph-bench` rather
than extracted into `codegraph-store` to avoid changing store source during the
parallel CRUD work. It preserves `.schema` statement order, strips optional
`IF NOT EXISTS` from `CREATE TABLE/INDEX/VIRTUAL TABLE/TRIGGER`, trims line
whitespace, removes blank lines, joins statements with `;\n`, and enforces a
final `;\n`.

### Ruby fixture

A third golden fixture, `reference/golden/ruby/`, guards Ruby `receiver.method`
extraction (upstream #1110) that the other fixtures cannot reach — there are no
`.rb` files in `mini`/`godot`. It captures the four receiver-bearing-call edge
shapes:

- **instance-method call** — `@logger.log(message)` resolving to `Logger#log`
  (a `Calls` edge to the METHOD name, not the receiver).
- **class-method call** — `Formatter.shout(message)` resolving to
  `Formatter.shout` (a `Calls` edge to the method name).
- **`Const.new` construction** — `Logger.new` recorded as an `Instantiates` edge
  to the receiver class `Logger`, not a `Calls` edge to `new`.
- **bare `include`** — `include Greeting` still records an `Implements` edge
  (regression guard: the receiver.method path must not disturb it).

The minimal source corpus lives at `crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/ruby/`
(`service.rb`, `logger.rb`).

Regenerate the committed database + canonical JSON reproducibly from the corpus:

```bash
# 1. Copy the corpus to a clean directory (keeps the workspace index out of it).
rm -rf /tmp/cg-fixture-ruby
cp -r crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/ruby /tmp/cg-fixture-ruby

# 2. Index it with OUR binary (never hand-write the golden).
cargo build --release -p codegraph-rs
CODEGRAPH_NO_DAEMON=1 CODEGRAPH_NO_WATCH=1 \
  ./target/release/codegraph init /tmp/cg-fixture-ruby

# 3. Commit the produced database as the fixture's colby.db.
cp /tmp/cg-fixture-ruby/.codegraph/codegraph.db reference/golden/ruby/colby.db

# 4. Dump the canonical golden JSON + schema from that database.
cargo run -p codegraph-bench --bin bench -- \
  --gen-golden reference/golden/ruby/colby.db reference/golden/ruby
```

Like the Godot fixture, both the index and the dump are byte-stable, and the
`generated_golden_matches_committed_ruby_fixture` and
`upstream_db_is_self_equivalent_to_ruby_golden` tests in
`crates/codegraph-bench/tests/equivalence.rs` enforce it.

### Python fixture

The dedicated `reference/golden/python/` fixture guards Python bare
class-as-value references plus aliased imports (#1626) without changing the
shared `mini` corpus. Its seven indexed files live at
`crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/python/` and retain the original six positive
`References` edges:

- same-file class values in a direct return, assignment RHS, registry-pair
  value, call argument, and list literal;
- one cross-file `ImportedClass` value. The import syntax is present, but real
  Python nodes are not marked exported, so import Gate 3b is unreachable. This
  edge is intentionally resolved by Gate 3a's unique cross-file name match at
  confidence 0.8.

It also pins two negative boundaries: a tuple return does not recurse into
`TupleA`/`TupleB`, and a bare `handler` parameter remains an unresolved
`function_ref` rather than resolving to a same-named method. The undefined
`register(...)` calls used by the argument and method shapes legitimately remain
as two unresolved `calls` rows.

The added alias files pin three import-resolution contracts:

- `import top_level as top_alias; top_alias.top_func()` binds the receiver to
  module `top_level`, never to a global same-named callable;
- `from pkg import module as mod_alias; mod_alias.func()` prefers the existing
  module file `pkg/module.py`;
- `from imported_types import ImportedClass as ImportedAlias; return
ImportedAlias` preserves member-import semantics: both the import statement and
  the aliased class-as-value reference resolve to the class through the import
  (named Python imports use the absolute-module and top-level-definition
  fallback of upstream #1820, because Python symbols are never marked
  exported).

Missing/duplicate/ambiguous module aliases remain unresolved, and a claimed
module alias never falls through to global bare-name matching.

Since extraction version 14 the `pkg/__init__.py` file node carries its module
docstring (upstream #1905): a bare string literal first in a module, class or
function body is that node's docstring, joined after any preceding comment.

Regenerate the committed database and canonical artifacts from a clean corpus:

```bash
# 1. Copy the corpus to a clean directory (keeps the workspace index out of it).
rm -rf /tmp/cg-fixture-python
cp -r crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/python /tmp/cg-fixture-python

# 2. Index it with OUR release binary (never hand-write the golden).
cargo build --release -p codegraph-rs
CODEGRAPH_NO_DAEMON=1 CODEGRAPH_NO_WATCH=1 \
  ./target/release/codegraph init /tmp/cg-fixture-python

# 3. Commit the produced database as the fixture's colby.db.
mkdir -p reference/golden/python
cp /tmp/cg-fixture-python/.codegraph/codegraph.db reference/golden/python/colby.db

# 4. Dump canonical JSON + schema from that exact database.
cargo run -p codegraph-bench --bin bench -- \
  --gen-golden reference/golden/python/colby.db reference/golden/python
```

As with every fixture, compare only `nodes.json`, `edges.json`, `refs.json`,
`files.json`, and `schema.sql` byte-for-byte. `colby.db` itself is not a
byte-reproducibility contract because SQLite updates its header change counter.
Regenerate `schema.sql` from the database being committed; statement ordering
may differ between binary versions, but its normalized statement set must not.
The tests `generated_golden_matches_committed_python_fixture` and
`python_db_is_self_equivalent_to_python_golden` enforce database/artifact
self-equivalence.

### Kotlin fixture

The dedicated `reference/golden/kotlin/` fixture guards Kotlin callable
signatures (#1495) without changing a shared corpus. Its single source file,
`crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/kotlin/signatures.kt`, pins five positive
shapes: an explicit return, an inferred return, a generic return, a multiline
class method with a nullable generic return, and an extension function. The
`Processor` primary constructor is the negative boundary: the class signature
stays null and no constructor method is synthesized.

Regenerate the committed database and canonical artifacts from a clean corpus:

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/cg-fixture-kotlin
cp -r crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/kotlin /tmp/cg-fixture-kotlin
cargo build --release -p codegraph-rs
CODEGRAPH_NO_DAEMON=1 CODEGRAPH_NO_WATCH=1 \
  ./target/release/codegraph init /tmp/cg-fixture-kotlin
mkdir -p reference/golden/kotlin
cp /tmp/cg-fixture-kotlin/.codegraph/codegraph.db reference/golden/kotlin/colby.db
cargo run -p codegraph-bench --bin bench -- \
  --gen-golden reference/golden/kotlin/colby.db reference/golden/kotlin
```

As with every fixture, only the five text artifacts are byte-compared;
`colby.db` is not byte-reproducible. Compare `schema.sql` by normalized statement
set when an older binary changes statement ordering. The tests
`generated_golden_matches_committed_kotlin_fixture` and
`kotlin_db_is_self_equivalent_to_kotlin_golden` enforce database/artifact
self-equivalence.

### Scala fixture

`reference/golden/scala/` guards the Scala 3 inheritance and companion-object
fixes from upstream #1823 and #1824. Its two-file corpus under
`crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/scala/` pins all of these as one contract:

- the `tree-sitter-scala` 0.26.2 grammar accepts a class with multiple
  constructor parameter lists whose parent constructor also has multiple lists;
- one `extends A(...) with B with C` clause emits three separate, bare-name
  `Extends` edges;
- a Scala `object` is a `module`, while its same-named companion remains a
  `trait`; the inheritance edge resolves to the trait even when the object
  appears first in the file.

Regenerate it from the committed source corpus:

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/cg-fixture-scala
cp -r crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/scala /tmp/cg-fixture-scala
cargo build --release -p codegraph-rs
CODEGRAPH_NO_DAEMON=1 CODEGRAPH_NO_WATCH=1 \
  ./target/release/codegraph init /tmp/cg-fixture-scala
mkdir -p reference/golden/scala
cp /tmp/cg-fixture-scala/.codegraph/codegraph.db reference/golden/scala/colby.db
cargo run -p codegraph-bench --bin bench -- \
  --gen-golden reference/golden/scala/colby.db reference/golden/scala
```

`generated_golden_matches_committed_scala_fixture` and
`scala_db_is_self_equivalent_to_scala_golden` pin the canonical artifacts and
database-to-artifact agreement.

### Dart fixture

`reference/golden/dart/` guards upstream #1784 / PR #1865. The focused Dart 3
corpus at `crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/dart/extension_type.dart` proves an
`extension type MetersT` is class-like and owns `MetersT::km` and
`MetersT::report` as methods with their complete spans; `Widget::half` is the
ordinary-class control. This prevents either the old top-level-function shape
or the later complete member drop from returning unnoticed.

Regenerate it from the committed source corpus:

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/cg-fixture-dart
cp -r crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/dart /tmp/cg-fixture-dart
cargo build --release -p codegraph-rs
CODEGRAPH_NO_DAEMON=1 CODEGRAPH_NO_WATCH=1 \
  ./target/release/codegraph init /tmp/cg-fixture-dart
mkdir -p reference/golden/dart
cp /tmp/cg-fixture-dart/.codegraph/codegraph.db reference/golden/dart/colby.db
cargo run -p codegraph-bench --bin bench -- \
  --gen-golden reference/golden/dart/colby.db reference/golden/dart
```

`generated_golden_matches_committed_dart_fixture` and
`dart_db_is_self_equivalent_to_dart_golden` enforce the same two-layer
self-equivalence as the other re-indexable corpora.

### C++ fixture

A fourth golden fixture, `reference/golden/cpp/`, guards C++ `base_class_clause`
inheritance extraction (upstream #1043) that the other fixtures cannot reach —
there are no `.cpp`/`.hpp` files in `mini`/`godot`/`ruby`. It captures the
general C++ inheritance shapes plus templated-base stripping:

- **single public base** — `class D : public Base` resolving to `Base`
  (an `Extends` edge; the `public` access specifier is skipped).
- **templated base (stripped)** — `class T : public Container<int>` resolving to
  `Container` (template args stripped to the base name).
- **multiple inheritance** — `class Both : public Container<char>, public Plain`
  emitting two `Extends` edges (to `Container` and `Plain`).
- **struct base** — `struct S : Container<double>` resolving to `Container`
  (struct inheritance goes through the same path as class inheritance).
- **`::`-qualified templated base** — `class Q : public ns::Tpl<int>` recording
  an `Extends` ref to `ns::Tpl` (qualified head kept, template args stripped).
  Since the C++ namespace-prefix work (Release D) stores `Tpl`'s qualified name as
  `ns::Tpl`, this ref now RESOLVES to a real `Extends` edge (`Q` → `ns::Tpl`) in
  `edges.json` instead of remaining an unresolved ref.
- **plain derived declarations in `.h`** — `plain_derived.h` is promoted from
  the extension-default C parser to C++ by a full-source, lexically masked
  `class/struct Derived : Base` probe. It covers access modifiers, `virtual`,
  qualified names, and templated bases. `plain_header_negatives.h` pins the
  false-positive boundary: comments, strings, character literals,
  preprocessor text, bitfields, labels, and ternaries do not promote C source.

Three further files exercise the Release D C++ extraction gains:

- **namespace prefix + `ns::fn()` resolution** — `namespaced.cpp` defines
  `namespace ns { void compute() {} }` (qualified name `ns::compute`) and calls
  `ns::compute()` from `run_namespaced`; the call resolves to a `Calls` edge via
  the existing qualified-name matcher (no resolver change).
- **template-argument call stripping** — `templated_call.cpp` defines
  `template <typename T> void process(T)` and calls `process<int>(0)`; the
  `<int>` template args are stripped at extraction so the call links to `process`.
- **Unreal-Engine reflection-macro recovery + `.h` C++ detection** — `ue_actor.h`
  is a lean UE header whose only C++ signal is `class ENGINE_API UFoo : public
UObject` plus line-leading `GENERATED_BODY()`/`UPROPERTY(...)`/`UFUNCTION()`,
  a member-level `ENGINE_API`, and no explicit `public:`. Content sniffing
  reclassifies the `.h` to C++, and the offset-preserving pre-parse blanking
  recovers the `UFoo` class + its `Extends UObject` clause (both dropped before).

Five further files exercise the Batch B C/C++ gains:

- **C leading attribute macros** (upstream #1311) — `attr_macro.c` is the one `.c`
  file in this corpus (extension-mapped to `Language::C`, so it guards the C
  walker, not the C++ one). It `#define`s an attribute macro + a `VOID` macro,
  `typedef`s `UINT32`, and declares four functions: two behind the macro
  (`GoodName` with a macro return type, `LostName` with a typedef'd one), one
  without it (`NoAttr`, the control), and one pointer-returning (`PtrRet`).
  tree-sitter's C grammar reads the macro as the type and the real return type as
  the declarator, so before the fix these indexed under the RETURN TYPE's name
  (`VOID` / `UINT32`); the golden now pins all four under their real names with
  their real return types. The blank fires ONLY because `#define SEC_ATTR
__attribute__((section(".init")))` is visible IN THIS FILE — the pass demands
  same-file `#define` proof that a leading token is attribute-like, so this fixture
  also pins that evidence requirement, not just the macro's name.

- **namespaced out-of-line method + fully-qualified call** (upstream #1310) —
  `namespaced_member.hpp` declares `namespace simulator { class ManifestStartup }`
  with a static `Apply`, and `namespaced_member.cpp` defines it OUT OF LINE inside
  the same namespace block, then calls it through the fully-qualified path
  (`simulator::ManifestStartup::Apply(1)`) from a function OUTSIDE the namespace.
  The receiver qualifier is spelled relative to the namespace, so the golden pins
  the method at `simulator::ManifestStartup::Apply` (matching the class node's
  `simulator::ManifestStartup`) plus the `Calls` edge
  `run_manifest → simulator::ManifestStartup::Apply` resolved by
  `qualified-name` — the edge that a namespace-less qualifier loses.

- **out-of-line template method receivers** (upstream #1309) —
  `template_method.cpp` declares `template <typename T> class Box` with `get` /
  `set` and defines both OUT OF LINE (`template <typename T> T Box<T>::get()`).
  The receiver qualifier carries `<T>`, which the class node never spells, so the
  golden pins both methods at `Box::get` / `Box::set` (template args stripped)
  plus the `contains` edges from `class Box` to each — the link that a `Box<T>::`
  qualifier breaks.

A further file exercises the Batch B explicit-operator gain (upstream #1268):

- **explicit operator calls** — `operators.cpp` defines `struct Vec2` with
  `operator+` / `operator[]` / a plain `get`, then calls each through the
  EXPLICIT syntax (`a.operator+(b)`, `a.operator[](3)`, `p->operator+(b)`) plus
  one plain `a.get()` control. tree-sitter-cpp strands the `operator_name` in an
  ERROR child, so before the fix the extractor emitted the bare receiver (`a`)
  and no edge existed; the golden now carries four `Calls` edges resolved by
  `instance-method` at confidence 0.9 (`Vec2::operator+` twice,
  `Vec2::operator[]`, `Vec2::get`).

Seven further files exercise the Tier 3 aggregate work — MSVC COM `interface`
(upstream #1519) and first-class `union` nodes (upstream PR #1516). **This corpus
is the C-FAMILY corpus, not a strictly-C++ one**: it already held a `.c` file, and
Tier 3 adds a `.mm` file whose extension maps to the ObjC spec, so `cpp/` names the
family rather than the dialect.

- **MSVC COM `interface` positives** — `com_interface.hpp` carries `struct SControl`
  as the control plus three `interface` shapes (`IWidget : IBase` with a base clause,
  `IPlain` without one, and `INewlineBrace` with the brace on the next line). The
  keyword is not C++, so tree-sitter reads each as a `function_definition`: the
  container became a `function`, its member `Run` a free `function` instead of a
  `method`, and the base clause vanished. The offset-preserving pre-parse rewrites
  the line-leading keyword to `struct` + 3 spaces (9 bytes → 9 bytes, so every line
  and column is unchanged), and the golden now pins all three as `struct` with
  `IWidget::Run` a `method` and TWO `extends IBase` refs. `int interface_count = 0;`
  is the mid-line negative in the same file.
- **MSVC COM `interface` negatives** — `neg_interface.hpp` holds the five shapes the
  guard must DECLINE, and pins them by extraction-INVARIANCE rather than by "the
  substitution did not fire": a block comment containing `interface INegComment;`, a
  C++/CLI `interface class`, an `interface struct`, a raw string containing a full
  `interface INegGhost {…};` declaration, and a `#define` continuation line carrying
  `interface INegMacro`. The golden pins exactly THREE nodes, the sharpest value
  being `INegCli`'s `docstring` — the verbatim `interface INegComment;`. A
  comment-blind substitution rewrites that string to `struct    INegComment;`, which
  is how a leaking guard is caught. `INegCli`/`INegStructKw` staying `function` is
  pre-existing garbage from the C++/CLI misparse and is deliberately preserved.
- **C union** — `union_agg.c` (the second `.c` file, so the C walker is under test)
  covers `union Named` plus both `typedef union` RE-KINDS (`AnonU` and `NamedU` were
  `type_alias` before and are `union` now — node ids change), with `struct Ctl` /
  `AnonS` as controls and three negatives: `union Fwd;` (bodiless forward
  declaration, stays unindexed, `struct FwdS;` as its control) and
  `union { int q; } anon_var;` (anonymous, mints nothing, as the anonymous struct
  already did). `typedef union NamedTag { … } NamedU;` mints exactly ONE node named
  `NamedU`; the tag never becomes a node.
- **C++ union member method** — `union_agg.cpp` gives `union WithMethod` and
  `struct SWithMethod` a SAME-NAMED `read_field`, plus one call on each receiver.
  Before the fix the union's member leaked to file scope as a free `function`, so
  `w.read_field()` bound `SWithMethod::read_field` — a FALSE edge to the wrong type,
  not merely a missing one. The golden pins each call on its own receiver's member,
  so receiver type has to decide.
- **ObjC union** — `union_agg.mm` is the repo's ONLY Objective-C fixture (`.mm` maps
  to the ObjC spec). It pins `union ObjcU` beside `struct ObjcS`.
- **`Calls` → `Instantiates` promotion** — `instantiate_agg.cpp` has `Reg r = Reg();`
  where the union is the only node of that name (measured pre-fix: a DANGLING `calls
Reg` ref, because no union node existed to bind), with `Ctl c = Ctl();` as the
  control. The golden pins `instantiates mk_union -> union:Reg` and NO surviving
  `calls` edge.
- **`Instantiates` candidate ranking** — `instantiate_rank.cpp` has `Value v{1};`
  competing against a same-named `void Value()`. Measured pre-fix it bound
  `function:Value`, the WRONG target; the golden pins the union winning, with
  `Packet p{2};` as the control. Kept in a SEPARATE file from the promotion case on
  purpose: one file mixing both mechanisms would make either revert-proof ambiguous.
- **C designated-initializer macros** — `designated_macro.c` keeps
  `RESET_CONFIG(.field = VALUE)` bounded to its argument list so the following
  `after_reset` / `final_value` declarations remain independent functions.
- **C++ raw-string opacity** — `raw_string.cpp` proves annotation/macro text
  inside a raw string is never blanked while a genuine annotation whose argument
  contains a raw string still balances on its real closer.
- **C++ pure virtual ownership** — `pure_virtual.cpp` pins `= 0` declarations as
  abstract methods owned by `AbstractStore`, with overrides, prototypes, data
  fields, and function-pointer fields as controls. The same rule adds the four
  previously missing abstract `Ping` members to the existing
  `com_interface.hpp` controls; no pre-existing node or edge is removed.
- **C++ constructor owner/arity proof** — `constructor_resolution.cpp` emits a
  `Calls` edge only when one lexically owned constructor accepts the local
  initializer's positional arity. It pins default/braced/value positives plus
  aggregate-only, overload-ambiguous, namespace-ambiguous, and explicit-owner
  controls. Internal constructor probes are consumed after resolution and never
  remain as dangling call references.

**Why the union/struct members are named `read_field` and not `get`.** `get` is the
only duplicated symbol name in this corpus already (`operators.cpp:5` `Vec2::get`
and `template_method.cpp:12` `Box::get`), and one of those carries a live
2-candidate `calls` edge. Naming the new members `get` would take that candidate set
to four and put an existing, unrelated golden edge at risk of re-pointing — drift in
files this change has no business touching. `read_field` keeps the property that
matters (two same-named members inside the new file, so receiver type must
disambiguate) and drops the one that only adds risk.

The minimal source corpus lives at `crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/cpp/`
(`attr_macro.c`, `base.hpp`, `com_interface.hpp`, `derived.cpp`,
`instantiate_agg.cpp`, `instantiate_rank.cpp`, `namespaced.cpp`,
`namespaced_member.cpp`, `namespaced_member.hpp`, `neg_interface.hpp`,
`operators.cpp`, `constructor_resolution.cpp`, `plain_derived.h`, `plain_header_negatives.h`,
`pure_virtual.cpp`, `raw_string.cpp`, `designated_macro.c`,
`template_method.cpp`, `templated_call.cpp`, `ue_actor.h`, `union_agg.c`,
`union_agg.cpp`, `union_agg.mm` — 23 files). The inheritance base
classes live in a `.hpp` file (not `.h`,
which maps to `Language::C` by extension); `ue_actor.h` deliberately uses `.h` to
guard the content-based C++ reclassification, and `attr_macro.c` uses `.c` so the
C walker (not the C++ one) is the thing under test.

Regenerate the committed database + canonical JSON reproducibly from the corpus:

```bash
# 1. Copy the corpus to a clean directory (keeps the workspace index out of it).
rm -rf /tmp/cg-fixture-cpp
cp -r crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/cpp /tmp/cg-fixture-cpp

# 2. Index it with OUR binary (never hand-write the golden).
cargo build --release -p codegraph-rs
CODEGRAPH_NO_DAEMON=1 CODEGRAPH_NO_WATCH=1 \
  ./target/release/codegraph init /tmp/cg-fixture-cpp

# 3. Commit the produced database as the fixture's colby.db.
cp /tmp/cg-fixture-cpp/.codegraph/codegraph.db reference/golden/cpp/colby.db

# 4. Dump the canonical golden JSON + schema from that database.
cargo run -p codegraph-bench --bin bench -- \
  --gen-golden reference/golden/cpp/colby.db reference/golden/cpp
```

Like the Ruby fixture, both the index and the dump are byte-stable, and the
`generated_golden_matches_committed_cpp_fixture` and
`cpp_db_is_self_equivalent_to_cpp_golden` tests in
`crates/codegraph-bench/tests/equivalence.rs` enforce it.

### Rust fixture

`reference/golden/rust/` is the repository's Rust corpus. It retains the
original unit-struct/union contracts and now also pins generic `impl` ownership
and `self.field.method()` resolution:

- **unit structs are indexed** (upstream #1513 / PR #1514) — `lib.rs` declares
  `struct UnitStruct;` beside `BraceStruct { … }` and `TupleStruct(u8)`, and gives
  all three an `impl Greet for`. A bodiless `struct NAME;` is a COMPLETE definition
  in Rust, not a forward declaration, so before the fix the unit struct produced no
  node at all — and its `implements` edge went with it, leaving `UnitStruct::greet`
  an orphan naming a type the graph did not contain. The golden pins exactly three
  `struct` nodes and **four** `implements` edges (three structs + the union).
- **`union` is a first-class kind** (upstream PR #1516) — `union Bits` carries an
  inherent `impl` (`raw`) and a trait `impl` (`greet`). The golden pins `union:Bits`
  with `contains union:Bits -> method:raw`, `contains union:Bits -> method:greet` and
  `implements union:Bits -> trait:Greet`.
- **cross-file resolution** — `consumer.rs` calls `u.greet()` / `b.greet()` on a
  `&UnitStruct` and a `&Bits`, so `implements` and method resolution have to work
  across files rather than only within one.
- **implementing-type ownership** — `impl_ownership.rs` covers generic,
  lifetime, reference, qualified, inherent, and trait impls. Methods qualify
  under the implementing type, not the trait; only trait impls emit
  `Implements`. Tuple, `dyn`, raw-pointer, and primitive impls remain ordinary
  functions because there is no single safe owner.
- **validated self/field calls** — `self_field.rs` pins
  `self.inner.run()`/reference/`Box` wrappers to the unique project field type.
  `Option`, `Vec`, `Mutex`, generic, external, and ambiguous field types stay
  unresolved. A direct `self.method()` keeps the receiver and resolves only to
  the enclosing method owner's exact qualified member, including split inherent
  impls and trait impls. The corpus includes same-named decoys and a missing
  owner method; the latter stays in `refs.json` and never falls through to a
  global same-name guess. Genuine `self.run()` recursion keeps its self-edge,
  now at qualified-name confidence rather than proximity confidence.

**The Rust corpus deliberately makes NO instantiation claim.** An `instantiates` edge
fires only for the CALL-EXPRESSION construction form: `TupleStruct(2)` yes, a bare
path `UnitStruct` no, a struct literal `Bits { i: 0 }` no. A Rust union is
constructible only as `Bits { … }`, so no Rust union can ever emit that edge —
`make_unit` / `make_bits` are return-type references, not instantiation assertions,
and the golden carries zero `instantiates` edges. Instantiation is pinned in C++
instead (`instantiate_agg.cpp` / `instantiate_rank.cpp`), which is upstream's own
shape. The corpus carries **no `Cargo.toml`**: it is indexed, not compiled, and a
manifest inside the workspace tree could confuse `cargo`.

The four source files are `lib.rs`, `consumer.rs`, `impl_ownership.rs`, and
`self_field.rs`.

Regenerate reproducibly (identical recipe to the C++ fixture, substituting `rust`):

```

`rust_db_is_self_equivalent_to_rust_golden` enforce byte-stability.

### Lua fixture

`reference/golden/lua/` guards #1616 function expressions in assignments and
table fields. Its single `handlers.lua` source pins:

- `local localFn = function ... end` as one `Function` and no duplicate
  `Variable`;
- `M.assignedFn = function` and `M["bracketFn"] = function` as methods qualified
  `M::assignedFn` / `M::bracketFn`;
- nested constructor fields as `M.callbacks::onStart` and
  `M.callbacks::onStop`, while a computed key remains dynamic and emits no
  callable;
- every body `helper()` call attributed to its synthesized callable;
- `localFn()`, `M.assignedFn()`, and `M:assignedFn()` resolving to the intended
  target, with dot and colon calls sharing `M::assignedFn`.

Regenerate reproducibly:

```bash
mkdir -p reference/golden/lua

```

`generated_golden_matches_committed_lua_fixture` and
`lua_db_is_self_equivalent_to_lua_golden` enforce byte-stability.

### Go fixture

`reference/golden/go/` byte-pins `files.generated` — the content-header
generated-file detection ported from upstream #1500 (`16e1749`) plus the
Wrangler double-`by` fix (`57e0854`). It is the repo's only Go corpus, and the
only corpus where `files.generated` is anything other than `0`.

Go is the language that forces content detection to exist: its convention for a
generated file is a **comment banner**, not a filename suffix, so a machine-written
`payroll.go` sitting beside hand-written use-cases is invisible to the path-only
`is_generated_file`. Renaming is not an option — `payroll.go` is a legal, ordinary
Go filename.

Six files pin BOTH values of the flag, three each way:

| fixture              | `generated` | what it guards                                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `payroll.go`         | **1**       | pattern 1, Go's codified `Code generated … DO NOT EDIT.` — the #1500 defect itself                                      |
| `worker_types.go`    | **1**       | pattern 6 / CG-25, Wrangler's TWO `by` clauses (`Generated by Wrangler by running …`)                                   |
| `api.pb.go`          | **1**       | the PATH signal still writes 1 with no banner present                                                                   |
| `payroll_usecase.go` | **0**       | the must-not-demote side: hand-written code beside a generated sibling                                                  |
| `nightly.go`         | **0**       | pattern 6 PRECISION — one `by` clause (`generated by running the ETL job`) is ordinary prose                            |
| `generator.go`       | **0**       | the comment-line fence: the banner is a `const` string in the function BODY, so a generator's own source is not flagged |

`payroll.go` and `payroll_usecase.go` both define `ComputePay`, which is what makes
the ranking effect observable: without the content signal the generated definition
wins on name overlap alone.

Regenerate reproducibly (identical recipe to the Rust fixture, substituting `go`):

### Mini schema rebuild (schema-migration recipe)

`reference/golden/mini/` is the one corpus with **no re-indexable provenance** — it
is upstream-derived, and its `files.modified_at` is a JS `Date.now()`
(`typeof(modified_at) = real`, versus `integer` in every corpus we produce). So the
recipe above cannot regenerate it: re-indexing the fixture would replace upstream's
data with ours.

An in-place `Store::open` migration is also **not** sufficient when a schema
migration adds an index. `CREATE INDEX` APPENDS a `sqlite_master` row and never
reorders an existing one, and the golden `schema.sql` is a `sqlite_master` dump
compared as a strict string, so a migrated corpus accumulates its indexes in
migration order while a freshly-created one carries them in `BASE_SCHEMA` order.
That is why `mini` and `godot` used to carry `idx_edges_identity` LAST while the
other corpora carried it alphabetically.

For a schema migration, rebuild `mini` on the fresh schema and transplant its rows:

```bash
# 1. A fresh index over mini's own fixture → a database created from the CURRENT
#    BASE_SCHEMA, so every index lands in declaration order.
rm -rf /tmp/mini-rebuild && mkdir -p /tmp/mini-rebuild
cp -a crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/mini/. /tmp/mini-rebuild/
CODEGRAPH_NO_DAEMON=1 CODEGRAPH_NO_WATCH=1 \
  ./target/release/codegraph init /tmp/mini-rebuild
DB=/tmp/mini-rebuild/.codegraph/codegraph.db

# 2. Replace its freshly-extracted rows with mini's COMMITTED rows, preserving
#    the upstream-derived values instead of re-extracting them. Run from the repo
#    root — the ATTACH path is relative.
sqlite3 "$DB" "
  ATTACH DATABASE 'reference/golden/mini/colby.db' AS src;
  BEGIN;
  DELETE FROM unresolved_refs; DELETE FROM edges; DELETE FROM files;
  DELETE FROM nodes; DELETE FROM project_metadata;
  INSERT INTO nodes            SELECT * FROM src.nodes;
  INSERT INTO edges            SELECT * FROM src.edges;
  INSERT INTO unresolved_refs  SELECT * FROM src.unresolved_refs;
  INSERT INTO project_metadata SELECT * FROM src.project_metadata;
  INSERT INTO files (path, content_hash, language, size, modified_at, indexed_at, node_count, errors)
    SELECT path, content_hash, language, size, modified_at, indexed_at, node_count, errors FROM src.files;
  COMMIT;
  DETACH src;"

# 3. Commit as the fixture's colby.db, then re-derive the JSON + schema goldens.
cp "$DB" reference/golden/mini/colby.db
cargo run -p codegraph-bench --bin bench -- \
  --gen-golden reference/golden/mini/colby.db reference/golden/mini
```

Two constraints in that transplant are load-bearing:

- **The `files` insert MUST use an explicit column list.** `SELECT *` fails with
  `table files has N columns but 8 values were supplied` once a column is added,
  and the omitted column correctly takes its `DEFAULT`, which is exactly the
  migrated-but-not-re-extracted semantics the goldens should pin.
- **Do NOT transplant `schema_versions`.** `codegraph_store::test_support::
finalize_current_test_fixture` calls `Store::open` on a COPY of this database
  from seven call sites. Copying `mini`'s rows would leave `MAX(version)` behind
  the current schema on a database that already HAS the new column, so
  `run_pending_migrations` would fire the `ALTER TABLE` against it and every one of
  those tests would die on `duplicate column name: …`. Keeping the fresh rows
  leaves nothing pending, so `Store::open` is a no-op on the copy.

Verify the rebuild preserved provenance and normalised the order:

```bash
sqlite3 reference/golden/mini/colby.db 'SELECT DISTINCT typeof(modified_at) FROM files;'  # real
sqlite3 reference/golden/mini/colby.db 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM nodes;'                      # 13
sqlite3 reference/golden/mini/colby.db 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM edges;'                      # 21
diff reference/golden/mini/schema.sql reference/golden/cpp/schema.sql                      # byte-equal
```

That last `diff` is the real proof: the rebuilt `mini` schema is now the same text
as a freshly-created corpus's, so every corpus `schema.sql` shares one hash.

### Metal fixture

A fifth golden fixture, `reference/golden/metal/`, guards Metal Shading Language
support (upstream #1121 / `cc89146`). MSL ≈ C++14 and rides the existing
`tree-sitter-cpp` grammar — `.metal` maps to `Language::Cpp` with **no new
`Language` variant**. It guards the `.metal`-gated `[[attribute]]` blank: MSL's
post-declarator attributes (`float4 position [[position]];`) otherwise misparse a
struct field into a spurious `extends` edge from the struct to the field's own
type. The corpus (`crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/metal/shader.metal`) defines
`float4`/`float2` structs, a `VertexIn` struct whose fields carry
`[[position]]`/`[[user(locn0)]]` attributes on those self-defined types, and a
`vertex_main` function that calls a `tint` helper. The golden must show:

- `shader.metal` with `"language": "cpp"`;
- `VertexIn`/`float4`/`float2` as ordinary structs with **no `Extends` edge**
  (the attribute blank prevents the spurious `VertexIn extends float4`);
- the intra-shader `vertex_main` → `tint` `Calls` edge.

The `[[attribute]]` blank fires ONLY for `.metal` files; a `.cpp`/`.hpp` with a
regular `[[nodiscard]]` attribute is byte-identical through pre-parse (proven by
the `metal_attribute_blanked_only_for_dot_metal` unit test in `lang/cpp.rs`).

### CUDA fixture

A sixth golden fixture, `reference/golden/cuda/`, guards CUDA support (the
CUDA-language parts of upstream #1172 / `e1a8d88`). CUDA ≈ C++ + dialect tokens
and likewise rides `tree-sitter-cpp` — `.cu`/`.cuh` map to `Language::Cpp` with
**no new `Language` variant**. It guards the CUDA pre-parse blank (execution-space
specifiers + `<<<grid, block>>>` launch configs, offset-preserving and
brace-balance-checked) and macro-defined-kernel name recovery. The corpus
(`crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/cuda/kernel.cu`) defines a `__global__ void
add_kernel`, a templated `__global__ scale_kernel`, a
`DEFINE_FLASH_FORWARD_KERNEL(my_kernel, …)` macro-defined kernel, and a `launch`
host function with a plain launch and a templated launch. The golden must show:

- `kernel.cu` with `"language": "cpp"`;
- `add_kernel`, `scale_kernel`, `my_kernel`, `launch` as functions — the
  macro kernel under its real name `my_kernel`, NOT `DEFINE_FLASH_FORWARD_KERNEL`;
- host→kernel `Calls` edges `launch` → `add_kernel` and `launch` → `scale_kernel`
  (the `<<<…>>>` blank restores the call; the templated launch rides the
  already-landed template-argument strip).

The CUDA blank fires for `.cu`/`.cuh` files OR any C/C++-family file whose content
carries a strong CUDA marker (`__global__`/`__device__`/`__constant__`/
`cudaStream_t`), so CUDA living in `.h`/`.hpp` headers is recognized.

Regenerate both new fixtures reproducibly (identical recipe to the C++ fixture,
substituting `metal`/`cuda`):

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/cg-fixture-metal && cp -r crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/metal /tmp/cg-fixture-metal

cp /tmp/cg-fixture-metal/.codegraph/codegraph.db reference/golden/metal/colby.db
cargo run -p codegraph-bench --bin bench -- --gen-golden reference/golden/metal/colby.db reference/golden/metal
# …and the same for cuda.
```

The `generated_golden_matches_committed_{metal,cuda}_fixture` and
`{metal,cuda}_db_is_self_equivalent_to_{metal,cuda}_golden` tests in
`crates/codegraph-bench/tests/equivalence.rs` enforce byte-stability.

### ArkTS fixture

A seventh golden fixture, `reference/golden/arkts/`, guards ArkTS (HarmonyOS /
OpenHarmony `.ets`) extraction (the extraction slice of upstream #1186 /
`9915221`). Unlike Metal/CUDA, ArkTS is a **new `Language::ArkTs` variant** backed
by a **dedicated `tree-sitter-arkts` grammar** — a TypeScript-superset fork that
understands the ArkUI `@Component struct` syntax `tree-sitter-typescript` cannot
parse. `.ets` maps to `Language::ArkTs`; plain `.ts` stays TypeScript. The corpus
(`crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/arkts/component.ets`) has an `import`, a global
`function helper`, a `function driver` that calls `helper`, a `@Component struct
MyView` with a `build()` method, and a plain `class Model`. The golden must show:

- `component.ets` with `"language": "arkts"`;
- `MyView` as a `NodeKind::Struct` with its `build` method as a member (via the
  existing `extract_struct` path — no walker change);
- `helper`/`driver` functions, the `Model` class, and the `../foo` import node;
- the `driver` → `helper` `Calls` edge (plain `call_expression`);
- the `MyView::build` → `helper` `Calls` edge from line 12. `tree-sitter-arkts`
  0.3 parses the call inside the `@Component struct`'s `build()` method; 0.2 did
  not, so this edge first appeared when #280 moved the grammar from 0.2 to 0.3
  and the fixture was regenerated with the recipe below. Only `edges.json` and
  `colby.db` changed.

The ArkUI dynamic-dispatch / callback-synthesizer bridges are DEFERRED — the
port has no callback synthesizer. So `ARKTS_SPEC` uses `call_types =
["call_expression"]` only (no `arkui_component_expression` component-instantiation
edges) and does NOT override `extract_modifiers` (the decorator hook). Adding the
variant is byte-neutral for `colby.schema.sql` (language is a stored TEXT value,
not DDL) and for the six existing goldens (none holds a `.ets` file).

Regenerate reproducibly (identical recipe to the C++ fixture, substituting
`arkts`):

cargo run -p codegraph-bench --bin bench -- --gen-golden reference/golden/arkts/colby.db reference/golden/arkts
```

The `generated_golden_matches_committed_arkts_fixture` and
`arkts_db_is_self_equivalent_to_arkts_golden` tests in
`crates/codegraph-bench/tests/equivalence.rs` enforce byte-stability.

### Solidity fixture

An eighth golden fixture, `reference/golden/solidity/`, guards Solidity (`.sol`)
extraction (upstream #1170 / `1441933`). Solidity is a **new `Language::Solidity`
variant** backed by a **dedicated `tree-sitter-solidity` grammar**. `.sol` maps to
`Language::Solidity`. The corpus (`crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/solidity/`) has
an `IERC20.sol` interface and a `Token.sol` that imports it, declares a file-level
`error` and a file-level `constant`, and a `contract Token is IERC20` carrying a
state variable, an `event`, an `enum`, a `struct`, a `modifier`, a `constructor`,
`fallback`/`receive`, and a `transfer` function guarded by the modifier that
`emit`s the event, plus a `library Math`. What it guards:

- both `.sol` files with `"language": "solidity"`;
- `contract Token` / `library Math` as `NodeKind::Class`, `interface IERC20` as
  `NodeKind::Interface`, `struct Holder` as `NodeKind::Struct`, `enum Status` as
  `NodeKind::Enum` with its `Active`/`Closed` members (bare-text `enum_value`);
- functions/modifiers/methods, including the synthetic `constructor` / `fallback`
  / `receive` method names (nameless grammar nodes);
- state variable / struct member / `event` / `error` as `NodeKind::Field` name
  nodes (direct-`name` field, no `variable_declarator`), including the file-level
  `Unauthorized` error and the file-level `MAX_SUPPLY` constant;
- the `./IERC20.sol` import node + `imports` edge;
- `is`-inheritance emitted as an `Extends` ref, promoted by the EXISTING resolver
  to an `Implements` edge `Token → IERC20` (interface target, present in-corpus);
- `emit`/header `modifier_invocation` `Calls` edges (`transfer → Transfer`,
  `transfer → onlyOwner`), resolved to same-file targets.

Because the fixture is fully self-contained, every ref resolves in-corpus, so
`refs.json` is empty and `edges.json` holds only RESOLVED edges — the expected
post-resolution state. No `FrameworkResolver` impl is involved; the
`Extends → Implements` promotion is the same path Java/C# use
(`resolver.rs:1231-1247`). Adding the variant is byte-neutral for
`colby.schema.sql` (language is a stored TEXT value, not DDL) and for the seven
existing goldens (none holds a `.sol` file).

Regenerate reproducibly (identical recipe to the ArkTS fixture, substituting
`solidity`):

### Nix fixture

A ninth golden fixture, `reference/golden/nix/`, guards Nix (`.nix`) extraction
(upstream #1190 / `7f32513`, the extraction slice only). Nix is a **new
`Language::Nix` variant** backed by a **dedicated `tree-sitter-nix` grammar**.
`.nix` maps to `Language::Nix`. Because Nix is an expression language with no
C-family `class`/`struct`/`method`/`enum` node kinds, `NIX_SPEC` has all-empty
type-sets and the extraction is driven by the `Language::Nix`-guarded
`visit_nix_node` walker extension. The corpus
(`crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/nix/`) has a top-level lambda
`{ pkgs, lib }: …`, a `let … in`, a returned attrset with bindings, an
`import ./foo.nix`, a `pkgs.callPackage ./bar.nix { }`, an `inherit lib;`, an
`imports = [ ./foo.nix ./bar.nix ]` module list, and a curried `build = { src }:
…` lambda. What it guards:

- all three `.nix` files with `"language": "nix"`;
- a `binding` whose value is a lambda → `NodeKind::Function` with a formatted
  curried-param signature (`build` → `{ src }`, `double` → `(x)`);
- a non-lambda `binding` and each `inherit`ed name → `NodeKind::Variable`;
- `import ./foo.nix`, `callPackage ./bar.nix { }`, and the literal
  `imports`-list paths → `NodeKind::Import` nodes + `Imports` refs;
- an `apply_expression` call → `Calls` ref, deduped across curried levels
  (`pkgs.mkDerivation`, `pkgs.callPackage`, `stdenv.mkDerivation`).

The `imports`/`callPackage` path refs to `./foo.nix` / `./bar.nix` resolve
in-corpus (both files exist), so `refs.json` retains only the three unresolved
`Calls` refs — the module-system option-path synthesizer, lexical-scope
resolution gates, callback synthesizer, and import-resolver module-list wiring
that upstream bundles with the same commit are **DEFERRED**, so no new Nix
resolve code binds anything. Adding the variant is byte-neutral for
`colby.schema.sql` (language is a stored TEXT value, not DDL) and for the eight
existing goldens (none holds a `.nix` file).

Regenerate reproducibly (identical recipe to the Solidity fixture, substituting
`nix`):

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/cg-fixture-nix && cp -r crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/nix /tmp/cg-fixture-nix
cargo build --release -p codegraph-rs

cp /tmp/cg-fixture-nix/.codegraph/codegraph.db reference/golden/nix/colby.db
cargo run -p codegraph-bench --bin bench -- --gen-golden reference/golden/nix/colby.db reference/golden/nix
```

The `generated_golden_matches_committed_nix_fixture` and
`nix_db_is_self_equivalent_to_nix_golden` tests in
`crates/codegraph-bench/tests/equivalence.rs` enforce byte-stability.

### Terraform fixture

A tenth golden fixture, `reference/golden/terraform/`, guards Terraform/OpenTofu
(HCL) extraction (upstream #1173 / `6c24f4b`, the extraction slice only).
Terraform is a **new `Language::Terraform` variant** backed by a **dedicated
`tree-sitter-hcl` grammar** (`.tf`/`.tfvars`/`.tofu` → `Language::Terraform`).
HCL is intentionally generic — every top-level construct is a `block`
distinguished only by its first `identifier` child — so `TERRAFORM_SPEC` has
all-empty type-sets and extraction is driven by the `Language::Terraform`-guarded
`visit_terraform_node` walker extension. The corpus
(`crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/terraform/main.tf`) is a single deterministic
file with a `terraform {}` settings block, a `provider "aws"`, a
`variable "region"`, a `locals` block, a `data "aws_ami" "ubuntu"`, a
`resource "aws_s3_bucket" "b"`, a `module "vpc"`, and two `output` blocks. What
it guards:

- the `.tf` file with `"language": "terraform"`;
- block-type dispatch: `resource`/`data` → `NodeKind::Class` (qualified `T.N` /
  `data.T.N`), `module` → `NodeKind::Module` (`module.M`), `variable`/`output` →
  `NodeKind::Variable` (`var.V` / `output.O`, `is_exported`), `provider` →
  `NodeKind::Namespace` (`provider.P`), `locals` attributes → `NodeKind::Constant`
  per attribute (`local.k`);
- plain attribute-expression traversal refs
  (`var.X`/`local.X`/`module.M`/`data.T.N`/`<type>.<name>`) → `References`, with
  built-in heads (`each`/`count`/`self`/`path`/`terraform`) skipped.

The plain traversal refs with a unique same-file target resolve via the existing
generic qualified-name matcher: `var.region` ×3 → `variable "region"`,
`aws_s3_bucket.b` → the resource, `module.vpc` → the module (each an EDGE, absent
from `refs.json`). The undeclared `aws_kms_key.logs` stays the sole unresolved
`refs.json` row. The module-boundary `TerraformResolver`, `emitModuleWiring`'s
`:`-scoped refs (`module.M:file`/`:var.X`/`:output.X`), the `.tfvars`
top-level-assignment `var.X` ref, and the `module.M:output.<out>` scoped half of
`qualifyReference` are all **DEFERRED** — the port keeps its single
`GodotResolver` — so no `:`-scoped ref is emitted. Adding the variant is
byte-neutral for `colby.schema.sql` (language is a stored TEXT value, not DDL)
and for the nine existing goldens (none holds a `.tf`/`.tfvars`/`.tofu` file).

Regenerate reproducibly (identical recipe to the Nix fixture, substituting
`terraform`):

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/cg-fixture-terraform && cp -r crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/terraform /tmp/cg-fixture-terraform
cargo build --release -p codegraph-rs
CODEGRAPH_NO_DAEMON=1 CODEGRAPH_NO_WATCH=1 ./target/release/codegraph init /tmp/cg-fixture-terraform
cp /tmp/cg-fixture-terraform/.codegraph/codegraph.db reference/golden/terraform/colby.db
cargo run -p codegraph-bench --bin bench -- --gen-golden reference/golden/terraform/colby.db reference/golden/terraform
```

The `generated_golden_matches_committed_terraform_fixture` and
`terraform_db_is_self_equivalent_to_terraform_golden` tests in
`crates/codegraph-bench/tests/equivalence.rs` enforce byte-stability.

### Erlang fixture

`reference/golden/erlang/` retains the original Erlang extraction contract
(upstream #1165 / `6511722`) and now guards arity-qualified identity and
resolution (upstream `41c1075`). Erlang is form-based — a function's name lives
on its `function_clause`, the grammar emits one `fun_decl` per clause, and
`-spec`/type bodies also contain `call` nodes — so extraction remains in the
`Language::Erlang`-guarded walker extension rather than the C-family type sets.

The seven-file corpus under `crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/erlang/` pins:

- display names remain bare (`get`, `job`, `header`), while qualified names are
  `module::function/arity`, such as `store::get/1`, `store::get/2`,
  `multi::job/1`, and `multi::job/2`;
- adjacent clauses merge only when both name and arity match (`m::f/1` remains
  one function), while same-name/different-arity definitions remain distinct;
- exports and specs select the exact arity;
- local and remote calls carry arity, so `store:get/2` resolves while the
  deliberate `store:get/3` call stays unresolved instead of binding a sibling;
- `fun store:get/1` resolves as a function-value `References` edge;
- the statically safe `erlang:spawn(single, work, Args)` MFA form resolves
  `single::work/1`; `multi::job` stays unresolved when the runtime argument
  list does not prove whether `/1` or `/2` is intended;
- commas inside `<<Name, Value>>` do not inflate `binary_arg/1` or its call
  arity;
- the original module, record, macro, include, recursive-call, and
  type-position negatives in `m.erl` remain intact.

The unresolved set intentionally includes `store::get/3`, external library
calls such as `lists::map/2` and `maps::get/3`, `other::h/0`, the runtime
`erlang::spawn/3` calls themselves, and ambiguous `multi::job`. Variable-module
dispatch, dynamic MFA targets, behaviour callback contracts, and
`.app`/`.app.src` resource wiring remain outside this corpus. The CLI and MCP
node lookup normalize Erlang's source spelling `mod:fn/3` to the stored
`mod::fn/3` form.

Regenerate reproducibly (identical recipe to the Terraform fixture, substituting
`erlang`):

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/cg-fixture-erlang && cp -r crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/erlang /tmp/cg-fixture-erlang
cargo build --release -p codegraph-rs
CODEGRAPH_NO_DAEMON=1 CODEGRAPH_NO_WATCH=1 ./target/release/codegraph init /tmp/cg-fixture-erlang
cp /tmp/cg-fixture-erlang/.codegraph/codegraph.db reference/golden/erlang/colby.db
cargo run -p codegraph-bench --bin bench -- --gen-golden reference/golden/erlang/colby.db reference/golden/erlang
```

The `generated_golden_matches_committed_erlang_fixture` and
`erlang_db_is_self_equivalent_to_erlang_golden` tests in
`crates/codegraph-bench/tests/equivalence.rs` enforce byte-stability.

### CFML fixture

A twelfth golden fixture, `reference/golden/cfml/`, guards CFML / ColdFusion
extraction (upstream #1153 / `816bacb`, the scope-B extraction slice only). CFML
is a **new `Language::Cfml` variant** backed by the **dual-grammar
`tree-sitter-cfml`** crate (`.cfc`/`.cfm`/`.cfs` → `Language::Cfml`). A file's
dialect is picked by a first-token sniff (`is_bare_script_cfml`): script files
parse with the bundled `cfscript` grammar and drive the generic type-set
dispatch; tag files parse with the `cfml` tag grammar and are handled by the
`Language::Cfml`-guarded `visit_cfml_node` walker extension. The corpus
(`crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/cfml/`) has three deterministic files — a
script `Base.cfc`, a tag `Widget.cfm`, and a bare-script `Gadget.cfs`. What it
guards:

- all three files with `"language": "cfml"`;
- `Base.cfc` (script) → `NodeKind::Class` `Base` (named from the FILE — the
  cfscript `component` is unnamed) + `NodeKind::Function` `ping`;
- `Widget.cfm` (tag) → `NodeKind::Class` `Widget` (from the `name` tag-attr) +
  `NodeKind::Method` `doThing` (access `public`, returntype `void`), and a tag
  `extends="Base"` → `Extends`;
- `Gadget.cfs` (bare script) → `NodeKind::Class` `Gadget` (from the FILE) +
  `NodeKind::Property` `x` + `NodeKind::Function` `doThing`, and a script-style
  `extends="Base"` (`component_attribute`) → `Extends`;
- both `extends Base` refs RESOLVE to the `Base.cfc` component (edges);
  `Gadget.doThing`'s `helper()` call → an unresolved `helper` ref.

The `<cfscript>`-in-tag-body re-parse delegation, the `cfquery` SQL-body
extraction (`LANGUAGE_CFQUERY`), and the CFML framework RESOLVER bridges
(FW/1 / ColdBox / CFWheels, dotted/relative inheritance, receiver-type inference)
are all **DEFERRED**. Adding the variant is byte-neutral for `colby.schema.sql`
(language is a stored TEXT value, not DDL) and for the eleven existing goldens
(none holds a `.cfc`/`.cfm`/`.cfs` file).

Regenerate reproducibly (identical recipe, substituting `cfml`):

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/cg-fixture-cfml && cp -r crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/cfml /tmp/cg-fixture-cfml
cargo build --release -p codegraph-rs
CODEGRAPH_NO_DAEMON=1 CODEGRAPH_NO_WATCH=1 ./target/release/codegraph init /tmp/cg-fixture-cfml
cp /tmp/cg-fixture-cfml/.codegraph/codegraph.db reference/golden/cfml/colby.db
cargo run -p codegraph-bench --bin bench -- --gen-golden reference/golden/cfml/colby.db reference/golden/cfml
```

The `generated_golden_matches_committed_cfml_fixture` and
`cfml_db_is_self_equivalent_to_cfml_golden` tests in
`crates/codegraph-bench/tests/equivalence.rs` enforce byte-stability.

### TypeScript resolution fixture

The dedicated `reference/golden/typescript/` fixture guards TypeScript export
aliases, JavaScript-family import resolution, object-literal namespaces, and
inherited path aliases without changing the shared `mini` corpus. It has 16
indexed source files plus `tsconfig.json` and
`config/tsconfig.base.json`; source lines are contractual because node IDs
include the declaration line.

The original `runAll` function retains six positive `Calls` edges, in source
order:

- `viaConstAlias()` → the local `constTarget` function behind
  `export const constAlias = constTarget`;
- `viaNamedAlias()` → the local `namedTarget` function behind
  `export { namedTarget as namedAlias }`;
- `defaultExportAlias()` → the local `defaultTarget` function behind
  `export default defaultTarget`;
- `viaJsSpecifier()` from `./js_target.js` → `jsTarget` in `js_target.ts`;
- `viaCollision()` from `./collision.js` → `collisionTarget` in
  `collision.ts`, ahead of the real `collision.js` file;
- `viaExtensionless()` → `extensionlessTarget` in `extensionless.ts`, preserving
  the existing extensionless behavior.

Two negative rules make false positives visible: `viaMissing` remains the only
unresolved direct-import call and import pair in `refs.json`, with no `Calls`
edge; and no
`Calls` edge may target either the exported `Constant` `constAlias` or the
JavaScript `collisionTarget` in `collision.js`.

The expanded corpus also pins:

- local `api.run()` / `api.stop()` and imported `api.run()` / `api.stop()` to
  direct callable members of one exported object literal;
- source-range containment prevents the unrelated top-level `run` function
  from becoming the target, while nested `api.nested.run()` remains unresolved;
  since extraction version 14 it is retained as the qualified call site
  `api.nested.run` (upstream #1862), which only a framework resolver may bind;
- `tsconfig.json` extends the JSONC/trailing-comma
  `config/tsconfig.base.json`; the declaring config's `baseUrl` resolves
  `@fixture/aliased` to `src/aliased.ts`;
- extensionless imports consider `.xsjs` and `.xsjslib` after ordinary
  `.js`/`.jsx`/`.mjs`/`.cjs` candidates and before index candidates, so
  `legacy_helpers.xsjslib` resolves while `legacy_priority.js` still wins over
  the same-name `.xsjs` file.
- `callable_semantics.ts` pins extraction version 13: generator declarations,
  TypeScript interface method/property signatures, direct declarator-bound
  handlers, React `useCallback`/`useEffectEvent` handlers, and the supported
  curried-wrapper shape own their body calls. `useMemo` and array callbacks stay
  anonymous negatives. Its helper name is globally unique so adding the fixture
  cannot change confidence or target selection in the original 14 files.
- `commonjs_handlers.js` pins `exports.name = function` and
  `module.exports.name = function` as exported callables with body ownership;
  non-callable assignments and a later `handlers.onSave = …` remain ordinary
  values rather than fabricated CommonJS exports.

The v13 regeneration was accepted only after filtering the two new paths out of
all four canonical JSON artifacts and proving the original 14-file rows
byte-for-byte unchanged. This is the required review shape for future corpus
growth: an additive fixture must not silently perturb old resolution confidence.

Regenerate the committed database and canonical artifacts from a clean corpus:

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/cg-fixture-typescript
cp -r crates/codegraph-bench/fixtures/typescript /tmp/cg-fixture-typescript
cargo build --release -p codegraph-rs
CODEGRAPH_NO_DAEMON=1 CODEGRAPH_NO_WATCH=1 \
  ./target/release/codegraph init /tmp/cg-fixture-typescript
mkdir -p reference/golden/typescript
cp /tmp/cg-fixture-typescript/.codegraph/codegraph.db reference/golden/typescript/colby.db
cargo run -p codegraph-bench --bin bench -- \
  --gen-golden reference/golden/typescript/colby.db reference/golden/typescript
```

The `generated_golden_matches_committed_typescript_fixture` and
`typescript_db_is_self_equivalent_to_typescript_golden` tests in
`crates/codegraph-bench/tests/equivalence.rs` enforce artifact/database
self-equivalence. As for every fixture below the Godot caveats, do not compare
`colby.db` bytes; compare the four JSON artifacts byte-for-byte and compare
`schema.sql` as a normalized statement set when statement order differs.

### Retrieval and ranking wave (golden-neutral)

Explicit-path pinning in `codegraph_explore`, camel/segment explore seeding,
case-insensitive exact-name index seeks, and `[indexing].deprioritize` are
query/render-time behavior only. They do not modify extraction, resolution,
node IDs, files, nodes, edges, unresolved references, FTS schema, or any
committed golden artifact. That earlier wave required no extraction-version
bump of its own; the current version is `13` because of the later callable
extraction changes above. A golden change attributed only to retrieval or
ranking remains a regression, not expected output.

Planner tests lock exact-name hit, miss, and filtered probes to
`idx_nodes_lower_name`; search/MCP tests cover Variable/Constant seeds,
last-match-wins ranking rules, explicit-path bounds, pinned-file budgeting, and
same-process config reload. The normal equivalence suite remains the authority
that every extraction golden is byte-stable.

### KNOWN_DIFFS.md format

Tier-3 differences are allowlisted by grep-able lines in
`docs/upstream-sync/KNOWN_DIFFS.md` — the single path
`KnownDiffs::repo_doc_path` hardcodes
(`crates/codegraph-bench/src/oracle/diff.rs`):

```text
RULE tier=3 surface=<surface> key=<substring-or-*> justification=<short-token>
```

Only Tier-3 entries can be allowed. Tier-1 byte mismatches and Tier-2 multiset
mismatches always fail; the differ never weakens those tiers to pass —
`KnownDiffs::allows` returns `false` for anything that is not `Tier::Tier3`, and
`parse_rule` rejects `tier=1` / `tier=2` before that, so a Tier-1/Tier-2 rule
cannot even be written down.

The parser is fail-closed: an unparsable document fails every equivalence
assertion instead of being ignored. A `RULE` line is rejected when a token is
not `key=value`, a key or value is empty, a field name is outside
`tier`/`surface`/`key`/`justification`, a field is repeated, `tier` is anything
other than Tier-3, `surface` is outside the five surfaces the differ reports
(`nodes`, `files`, `schema`, `edges`, `unresolved_refs`), or any of the four
fields is missing. Lines inside a fenced code block are documentation, not
rules — including the template above — and an unterminated fence is an error,
because every `RULE` after it would otherwise be skipped silently.
