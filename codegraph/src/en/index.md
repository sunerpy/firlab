  tagline: CodeGraph parses a repository with tree-sitter into a local index of symbols, calls and imports, and answers structural questions from it, on the command line, for coding agents over MCP, and in a browser viewer. There is no model inside, so the same repository gives the same answer on every machine.

    title: What it does not do
    items:
      - It runs no model, no embeddings and no vector search; it answers from the parsed structure only.
      - It does not judge code. Whether it is correct stays with your compiler, linter and tests.
      - It does not see run time. Reflection, runtime callbacks and calls built from strings leave no edge.
      - It does not guess at languages it cannot parse.

## For coding agents

An agent with CodeGraph asks one structural question instead of searching and reading files one at a time, and gets
back the relevant source together with the calls between it. Answers come from the parsed code, so they are the
same on every run.

`codegraph install --yes` writes the MCP server into the config of Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Kiro, Zed, VS Code
and the other agents it supports.

## For you, in the browser

The viewer reads the same index: a symbol with its callers and callees, the call path from one function to another,
the repository as a map of modules, the hierarchy of a type, and the code nothing reaches. It runs on your computer
and only reads.

<SplitBlock proof="languages">

## Many languages, at an honest depth

Most languages get full symbol extraction. Components and templates get their embedded scripts and markup, and a few
formats are tracked at file level. The table says which is which, rather than one number for all of them.
