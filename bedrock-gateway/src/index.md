titleTemplate: false
description: bedrock-gateway is one Rust binary that serves Amazon Bedrock models through the OpenAI Chat Completions, Responses, Completions and Embeddings APIs, so the OpenAI SDKs, Codex CLI and other agents need only a base URL and a key.

hero:
  name: bedrock-gateway
  text: Amazon Bedrock behind the OpenAI APIs
  tagline: One Rust binary that answers OpenAI Chat Completions, Responses, Completions and Embeddings requests by calling Bedrock with your own AWS account. An OpenAI SDK or an agent needs a base URL and a key, and nothing else changes.

      text: A binary for Linux, macOS and Windows, or a container image for Linux, on your own machine, on ECS or on Lambda. It listens on port 8080.
    - term: Your AWS account
      text: Bedrock is called with a Bedrock API key or the standard AWS credential chain. Prompts go to Bedrock in your account.

  visual:
    label: A terminal session. One request goes to the Chat Completions route and one to the Responses route, both with Amazon Nova 2 Lite, and the gateway answers both with BEDROCK_OK.

    title: What bedrock-gateway does
    intro: Everything below works once the gateway has a key for its clients and AWS credentials; GPT-5.x and gpt-oss also need a Bedrock API key. Reasoning across tool calls on Chat Completions and OpenTelemetry export stay off until you turn them on.
    groups:
      - name: Serve
        items:
          - title: Chat Completions

  steps:
    title: From install to the first answer
    items:
      - title: Pull the image
        command: docker pull sunerpy/bedrock-gateway-rust
        body: Or download the binary for your platform from GitHub Releases, or install it with cargo.
      - title: Choose a key for your clients
        command: export API_KEY=sk-replace-with-a-private-random-key
        body: Every client sends this key. It is yours to choose and is not an AWS credential.
      - title: Start the gateway
        command: docker run -p 8080:8080 -e API_KEY -e AWS_REGION=us-east-1 -e AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK sunerpy/bedrock-gateway-rust
        body: AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK is a Bedrock API key. Without it the gateway uses the standard AWS credential chain.
      - title: Point a client at it
        command: http://localhost:8080/api/v1
        body: That is the base URL for the OpenAI SDKs, Codex CLI and other OpenAI-compatible clients.

    title: What goes where
    intro: bedrock-gateway sits between your clients and your AWS account. Apart from the image URLs clients send and an OpenTelemetry collector you configure, it talks to AWS only.
    sendsLabel: Goes to
    modes:
      - name: Model requests
        sends: Amazon Bedrock, in your account
        detail: The prompt, tools and images of each request go to Bedrock in the region you configure. The log records the model, token counts, cache hits and timing, never prompts, answers or keys.
      - name: Model list
        sends: The Bedrock control plane
        detail: At start and then on a schedule, the gateway lists the foundation models and inference profiles your account can call.
      - name: Image URLs
        sends: The host in the URL
        detail: When a message carries an http or https image URL, the gateway downloads the image and sends its bytes to Bedrock. A data URL is decoded in the gateway.
      - name: Client key
        sends: SSM or Secrets Manager, if you use them
        detail: When the key comes from Parameter Store or Secrets Manager, the gateway reads it there once at start. Otherwise it stays in the environment.

  scope:
    title: What it does not do
    items:
      - It does not store conversations. The Responses API is served without state, so previous_response_id and store are accepted and ignored.
      - It does not speak Anthropic Messages. Claude is served through the OpenAI APIs.
      - It does not run hosted tools such as web search or file search. A client's function tools pass through; hosted tools with no Bedrock counterpart are dropped.
      - It does not share access. Each gateway calls Bedrock with the one AWS account it is configured with.

## The OpenAI routes your clients already use

Each route takes the request an OpenAI client sends and answers in the same shape, streaming included. Features that
exist only on Bedrock, such as the 1-hour prompt cache, go in an `extra_body` object, which the OpenAI SDKs can add to
any request.

<SplitBlock proof="clients" flip>

## Your client stays as it is

The OpenAI SDKs take the gateway as their base URL. Codex CLI takes it as a custom model provider that speaks
Responses. Editors and agents with an OpenAI-compatible provider take a base URL, a key and a model ID, with no plugin
and no patched client.

## Bedrock's models, by the names you know

Claude, OpenAI's GPT models on Bedrock, Amazon Nova, DeepSeek and every other model in your catalog are called the same
way. Each model's quirks, such as which sampling parameters it accepts or how it reasons, live in a configuration file,
so a new model needs an entry there and no new release.
