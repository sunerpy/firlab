# Contributing

This page is for working on bedrock-gateway itself: the layout of the repository, the checks a change has to pass,
and how releases and this site are made.

## The repository

bedrock-gateway is written in Rust with axum, tokio and the AWS SDK for Rust. `rust-toolchain.toml` pins the
toolchain, and `rustup` installs it on the first build.

| Path             | Holds                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/server/`    | The HTTP server: routes, authentication, and the dispatchers that pick a backend for each model         |
| `src/openai/`    | The OpenAI wire types of Chat Completions, Responses and Completions                                    |
| `src/bedrock/`   | Translation to and from Bedrock Converse, streaming, caching, reasoning, embeddings and the OpenAI-compatible backend |
| `src/config/`    | Settings and the loaders of the model registry, the region routes and the embedding models              |
| `src/domain/`    | The traits the server calls, free of AWS types                                                           |
| `src/telemetry/` | Logging and the optional OpenTelemetry export                                                            |
| `config/`        | `models.toml`, `regions.toml`, `embeddings.toml` and `app.toml`: everything the gateway knows about models |
| `tests/golden/`  | Recorded requests and answers that the translation is checked against                                    |
| `deployment/`, `helm/` | The CloudFormation templates and the Helm chart                                                   |
| `docs/`          | The references; `docs/site/` is this site                                                                |

[`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/sunerpy/bedrock-gateway-rust/blob/main/AGENTS.md) holds the rules every change follows, for people and coding agents alike. Two of them
shape most changes: model knowledge lives in `config/models.toml`, never in the code, and features that exist only on
Bedrock reach it through `extra_body`, never through new top-level request fields.

## Build and test

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sunerpy/bedrock-gateway-rust
cd bedrock-gateway-rust
make hooks    # run make check before every git push
make check    # what CI runs: format check, clippy with all and with the default features, tests
```

`make check` runs clippy twice: with `--all-features`, which compiles the `otel` feature as well, and with the default
features, which are what the released binaries and images are built with. CI runs `make check`, the tests on Windows
and `cargo audit`, and `CI Success` requires all three, so a branch that passes the hook passes CI on Linux.

The tests run offline, with no AWS credentials. A change to a translation comes with a fixture in `tests/golden/`;
the golden tests compare answers by meaning, not byte for byte. Tests that call Bedrock are skipped unless asked for,
and need access to Bedrock in `us-east-2`:

```sh
BEDROCK_INTEGRATION=1 AWS_PROFILE=<your profile> cargo test -- --ignored
```

## Adding a model

A new model is a change to `config/models.toml` only; [Models](guide/models.md#add-or-change-a-model) describes the
entries. The Helm chart carries a copy in `helm/bedrock-gateway/files/models.toml`, and a test fails when the two
differ in any entry, so change both.

## Pull requests and releases

- Commit messages and pull request titles follow Conventional Commits, for example
  `fix: preserve image support in Responses translation`. release-please reads them to choose the next version.
- Pull requests are squash-merged into `main`; nothing is pushed to `main` directly.
- Releases are cut by release-please: its pull request bumps the version, and merging it creates the tag and a draft
  release. The same run checks the tagged commit, builds the binaries for five platforms and runs each one, attaches
  them with `SHA256SUMS` and an attestation, pushes the images to Docker Hub and Amazon ECR Public and the crate to
  crates.io, and only then makes the release public.

## This site

The pages of this site live in `docs/site/`, English at the root and Chinese under `zh/`, next to the code they
describe, so a change that alters what users see updates its page in the same pull request.
[`docs/site/README.md`](https://github.com/sunerpy/bedrock-gateway-rust/blob/main/docs/site/README.md) lists the rules for these pages. The site's theme and build live in
[sunerpy/firlab](https://github.com/sunerpy/firlab), which copies the pages in after every change to `main`.
