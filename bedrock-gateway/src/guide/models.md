# Models

This page explains which model IDs a request can name, how the gateway knows what each model accepts, and how to add
a model. The live answer to "what can I call" is always the model list:

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/models -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" | jq -r '.data[].id'
```

It lists the foundation models and inference profiles your account can call in the gateway's region, read from
Bedrock at start and again every `MODEL_CATALOG_REFRESH_SECS`, plus the short names below. A model that Bedrock
launches while the gateway runs appears there without a restart.

## Model IDs

A request names its model with any ID Bedrock accepts:

- a foundation model ID, such as `amazon.nova-pro-v1:0`, for a model your region serves on demand;
- a cross-region inference profile ID, such as `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0` or
  `global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-5-5`, which Bedrock routes across regions. Most recent models are available only
  this way;
- an application inference profile ARN from your account;
- one of the gateway's short names, such as `gpt-5.5`, listed below.

The gateway sends the ID to Bedrock as you wrote it, so a profile keeps its routing. The prefixes `us.`, `eu.`,
`apac.`, `jp.`, `au.`, `ca.` and `global.` all work.

## Claude

Claude Sonnet, Opus, Haiku and Fable are served through Bedrock's Converse API, on both Chat Completions and
Responses. Recent versions are reached through inference profiles, for example `global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-5-5`,
`us.anthropic.claude-opus-5-5`, `global.anthropic.claude-haiku-5-5` or `global.anthropic.claude-fable-5-1`.

The gateway handles the differences between versions for you. On the versions that reject `temperature` and
`top_p`, it drops them. On the versions that think adaptively, `reasoning_effort` becomes the effort the model
expects. When a version does not accept a conversation that ends with an assistant message, the gateway adds a short
user turn that asks the model to continue.

`response_format` and the Responses `text.format` go to Bedrock as structured output on every version, and Bedrock
decides whether the version takes it; one that does not, such as Fable 5, answers with HTTP 400. On Claude, every
object in a JSON schema must set `additionalProperties: false`.

## OpenAI GPT

OpenAI's models on Bedrock are called by short names:

| Name                                               | Served through                       | Chat Completions | Responses |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------- | --------- |
| `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.5`                               | Bedrock's OpenAI-compatible endpoint | Yes              | Yes       |
| `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, `gpt-5.6-luna`     | Bedrock's OpenAI-compatible endpoint | Yes              | Yes       |
| `gpt-6.1-sol`, `gpt-6-sol`, `gpt-6-luna`, `gpt-6-astra` | Bedrock Converse, global profile | Yes              | Yes       |
| `gpt-oss-120b`, `gpt-oss-20b`                      | Bedrock's OpenAI-compatible endpoint | Yes              | No        |

- **GPT-5.x and gpt-oss** go to Bedrock's OpenAI-compatible endpoint, which needs a Bedrock API key
  (`AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`) and is available in a few regions only: `us-east-1`, `us-east-2` and `us-west-2`,
  depending on the model. In another region the gateway answers with HTTP 400. On Chat Completions, GPT-5.x is served
  by translating to and from the Responses API, and its reasoning summary appears in `<think>` tags.
- **GPT-6.x** goes through Bedrock Converse with the `global.openai.*` inference profile, so it needs no Bedrock API
  key and works wherever that profile does. The `us.openai.*` and `global.openai.*` IDs work as well.
  `reasoning_effort` becomes `reasoning.effort`, `temperature` and `top_p` are dropped because these models reject
  them, and structured output uses the strict JSON schema the models support.

## Other models

Amazon Nova, DeepSeek and every other model in your catalog are served through Bedrock Converse with no extra setup.
On xAI Grok 4 and Moonshot Kimi K3, which refuse `temperature` and `top_p`, the gateway drops both. A model's limits
are Bedrock's: when a model does not support images, tools, streaming or structured output, Bedrock's error comes back
to the client.

Embeddings use their own registry. The [API reference](../reference/api.md#embeddings) lists the supported families.

## How the gateway knows a model

What each model accepts lives in a registry, [`config/models.toml`](https://github.com/sunerpy/bedrock-gateway-rust/blob/main/config/models.toml), not in the code.
An entry matches a fragment of the model ID and sets, for example:

- whether the model rejects `temperature` and `top_p`;
- which form of reasoning it takes;
- the smallest prompt prefix worth caching, and whether it supports a 1-hour cache;
- which backend serves it, and in which regions.

A model with no entry is served with the defaults: no reasoning parameters and no prompt caching, except for a Claude
ID, which gets a conservative cache threshold.

## Add or change a model

1. Copy `config/models.toml` from the release you run into a directory, for example `/etc/bedrock-gateway/config/`.
2. Add or change an entry:

   ```toml
   [[model]]
   match = "provider.model-name"
   capabilities = ["drop_sampling_params", "no_assistant_prefill"]
   [model.params]
   cache_min_tokens = 1024
   reasoning_path = "adaptive_thinking"
   ```

3. Start the gateway with `CONFIG_DIR` pointing at that directory.

When two entries match one ID, the first one in the file supplies the parameters, so put a more specific entry, such
as `claude-sonnet-5-5`, above a shorter one, such as `claude-sonnet-5`. The capability flags of every matching entry
add up. The comments at the top of `models.toml` describe every flag and parameter.

A short name is an `[[alias]]` entry, which must come before the first `[[model]]`:

```toml
[[alias]]
from = "my-model"
to = "global.provider.model-name"
```
